Then `run` should actually _use_ `nativeLink.value` as the path to the executable, rather than asking separately for `nativeBinary`.\n\nTo be even more idiomatic, it should be `taskKey[Attributed[Filed]]`. You might not realize yet, but eventually you'll need the attributes for one reason or another (we did).\n",
