        "body" : "@SamirTalwar That is not how Azure works. Not sure what you searched for, but if the variable doesn't exist at the Azure level, or if the syntax is wrong (as was the case here), Azure simply does not replace anything. So in this case Bash did get the literal `\"$(variables['SourceBranchName'])\"` and that is why Bash (not Azure preprocessing) printed\r\n```\r\n/home/vsts/agent/_work/_temp/7a958ea0-e48d-4658-9200-9d933a35582a.sh: line 11: variables[Build.SourceBranchName]: command not found\r\n```\r\nfrom its subshell, of which the return status is ignored despite `-e` because we're inside a `[]` (I think).\r\n\r\nSo I don't think the `[ -n ]` will help here. From my understanding of `-e` (`-u` is irrelevant here as from Bash's perspective there is no variable involved, just a subshell, so nothing that can be unset), this should fail properly on the subshell failing:\r\n```suggestion\r\n    branch=\"$(Build.SourceBranchName)\"\r\n    if [ \"$branch\" = \"master\" ]; then\r\n```\r\nEither way, we now have the correct syntax so this will never fail (ðŸ¤ž), as the `Build.SourceBranchName` variable should always be set by Azure.",
