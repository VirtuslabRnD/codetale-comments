The main issue there seems to around the `release_notes.rst` which will turn into a mess if releases start overlapping which will probably happen at some point (e.g. you need a 1.0.2 after 2.0) and the `LATEST` file might be a bit confusing. I think both of those are perfectly acceptable for now. We just should make it a conscious decision.",
