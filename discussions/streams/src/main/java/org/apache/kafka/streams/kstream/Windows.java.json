No I don't think that's what we want. 24 hours is still good to use, if user believe that's what they want. That means, we don't **deprecate** the 24 hours grace period, just don't set as default value, so we should not name it as \"deprecated\", \"old\", things.\r\n\r\nCorrect me if I'm wrong, @izzyacademy @ableegoldman . Thank you",

The reasoning for deprecating the constant is explained thoroughly in the KIP so I think they will understand. I can add more details to the Java comments to clarify. But thanks @showuon  for bring it up in the review.",

        "body" : "Yeah it's an internal config so I hope they wouldn't assume anything from the name and extrapolate to what they can and can't use. That said, it does appear in these classes which are public themselves, so users are still going to see it. But the important thing is that it makes sense to us, the devs, who will actually be using it -- I think `DEPRECATED_DEFAULT_24_HR_GRACE_PERIOD` is a bit more clear, just need to sneak the word \"default\" in there somewhere imo",
