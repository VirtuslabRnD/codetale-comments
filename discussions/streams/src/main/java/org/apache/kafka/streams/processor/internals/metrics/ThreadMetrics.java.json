Is there any changes intentional here?",

        "body" : "@guozhangwang, I checked `commitOverTasksSensor` and `commitSensor`. First of all, I have not changed anything in this PR regarding the public interface, i.e. tags and groups. \r\n\r\nFrom an implementation point of view, in this PR `commitOverTasksSensor` is created and added to the metrics on thread-level, which I think is better as the current implementation that relies on the idempotency of adding a sensor and adds each time a task is created (cf. https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/b042b36674f0bd8046f0229c96e0b8cf99554b2b/streams/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/streams/processor/internals/StreamTask.java#L99-L116).\r\n\r\nHowever, now I am also a bit confused about `commitSensor` and `commitOverTasksSensor`. `commitSensor` measures commits on thread-level whereas `commitOverTasksSensor` aggregates measurements of commits on task-level. Hence, `commitSensor` approximately subsumes `commitOverTasksSensor`. Furthermore, `commitSensor` does also measure commits of stand-by tasks. Looking at KIP-444, we will get rid of `commitOverTasksSensor`.",

        "body" : "Yeah I know that KIP-444 would only maintain the `commitSensor` on thread-level, and on task-level, and these two would not have a parent-children relationship any more. What I'm just confused is if we have ever changed any protocol in this PR. As long as nothing is changed I think it is okay -- and probably we just had some old error code which we are going to get rid of in KIP-444 anyways.\r\n\r\nLet me do a double check and if that confirms my conjecture, we can merge it as is.",
