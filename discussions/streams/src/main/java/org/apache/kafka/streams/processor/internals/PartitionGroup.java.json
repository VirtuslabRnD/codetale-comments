Then, we would only ever have to look at the first queue in the sorted collection to find the new stream time.\r\n\r\nHowever, this requires more bookkeeping during put and poll, so I'd like to avoid it for now. We can make this optimization if this method is a bottleneck (but I doubt it will be).",
