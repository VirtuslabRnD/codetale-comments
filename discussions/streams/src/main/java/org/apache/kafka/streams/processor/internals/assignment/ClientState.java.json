In both cases, the `endOffset` <= `logEndOffset` so the invalid offset should also satisfy `offset` > `endOffset` which we can detect and throw as `TaskCorrupted`. \r\nAlready-assigned: in this case, we must have been the ones who wrote the invalid offset and/or have it in our `checkpointableOffsets` map. But we still need to fetch the `endOffset` to know when to stop, so the above applies here as well and we can detect the corruption. \r\n\r\nIn either case, I'd agree the leader should not throw and should just treat that task's offset sum as 0.
