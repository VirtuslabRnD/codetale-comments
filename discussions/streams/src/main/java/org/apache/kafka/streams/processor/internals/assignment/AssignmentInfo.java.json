It's just easier to read when each one in isolation lists all the operations it needs to do.\r\n\r\nIt's also more general, since a hypothetical future version N might add some new metadata in the middle, or even drop some previous metadata and so wouldn't be able to call decodeVersion{N-1} in its implementation.",
