After second thought, what I can do is to change the thrown exception to `IllegalStateException` to let it fail immediately than trying to cover any unknown issues. WDYT?",

However, we might not learn about issues as user might never recognize this log entry and thus never report. (Maybe we should log this as an ERROR and explain in the message that Streams will auto-recover from this, but people should please report that this happened? -- This would at least increase the likelihood to get a report.)\r\n\r\nFor `IllegalStateException` it would be the other way round... Guess it depends on the likelihood of a bug hitting this? If it's rare, failing might be better?\r\n\r\nBut not sure. \\cc @bbejeck @dguy ",
