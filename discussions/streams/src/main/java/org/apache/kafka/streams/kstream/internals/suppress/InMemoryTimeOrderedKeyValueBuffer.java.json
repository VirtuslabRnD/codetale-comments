        "body" : "This could be configurable in the future, but for now, we enforce the time limit in the following fashion:\r\n* start a timer when a key first enters the buffer\r\n* that key and its most recent value will be emitted when the time limit expires, regardless of how recently it has been updated\r\n\r\nThe primary advantage of this implementation is that we guarantee that if you set a 5-minute limit, we delay emitting the key for no more than five minutes. If we instead re-set the timer on each update, you might never see a record that gets consistently updated more frequently than the time limit.\r\n\r\nMy judgement was that this is the most intuitive default and starting point for the feature. If people want to configure it, we can easily add that option later.",
