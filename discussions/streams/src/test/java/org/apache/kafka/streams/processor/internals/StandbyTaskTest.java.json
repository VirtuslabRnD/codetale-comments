It looks like it wanted to try updating without previously initializing the task.\r\n\r\nThis was previously throwing an NPE wrapped in a ProcessorStateException when the adapted callback actually tried to dereference the (null) wrapped callback.\r\n\r\nNow, the NPE is surfaced a little earlier, not guarded by the ProcessorStateException try/catch.\r\n\r\nI think this is still ok, so I've just refined the test to be more specific.",
