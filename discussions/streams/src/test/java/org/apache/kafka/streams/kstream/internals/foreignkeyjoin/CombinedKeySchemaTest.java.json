These strings are only dummy values, and they appear only once in the test, so there's no safety/consistency savings by declaring a field. There's no reason all the tests _need_ the same strings here, so a field actually creates indirection and coupling where it doesn't provide any value. And the name of the variable would be about as long as the string itself.\r\n\r\nI get the impression this won't bother you either way, but it seemed rude not to respond, if I wasn't going to take the suggestion.",
