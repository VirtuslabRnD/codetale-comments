We should absolutely migrate them all to the new APIs (of course we will be forced to once the deprecated ones are removed), but it's ok with me, and maybe even slightly preferable, to do this in a followup PR. That way we can keep this PR focused on the changes themselves and just the tests for the new APIs.\r\n\r\nCan you file a ticket to migrate all of the remaining tests over to the new APIs and remove the warning suppression? Then you can start working on that after this PR is merged, or in parallel with the review but on a separate branch",
