If the latter, I guess, you should tag this class as an integration test.\r\n\r\nAlso, I run the test on my machine locally and I got two failures due to time outs for `FallbackPriorTaskAssignor`, namely for `testManyStandbys()` and `testLargePartitionCount()`. Admittedly, at that time my machine was under high load, but I guess that could also happen on Jenkins. Should we use lower parameter values? ",
