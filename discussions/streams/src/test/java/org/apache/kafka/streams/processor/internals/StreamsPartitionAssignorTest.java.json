        "body" : "The story here is that (I think wrongly), the tests were using the task manager via the config map before, but not always initializing the mock. I guess a lot of the tests never accessed its methods before. I also guess that the mock just returns `null` for field accesses (specifically `adminClient`), but it doesn't validate the field access. Now that it's a method, it need the expectation of the call always, so we always need to initialize the mock now.\r\n\r\nThe changes I made in this class are related to this. Basically, we always initialize the taskManager mock before using it to configure the StreamsPartitionAssignor.",
