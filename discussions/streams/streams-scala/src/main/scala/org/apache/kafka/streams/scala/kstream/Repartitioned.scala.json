Seems we are missing something here? If there is more than one optional parameter, it seems we should have non-static method to allow method chaining? (Could be fixed in a follow up PR)",

Since we've found so much wackiness in the Scala API since it was introduced, it might be a good idea to consider revamping the whole thing from scratch some day.",
