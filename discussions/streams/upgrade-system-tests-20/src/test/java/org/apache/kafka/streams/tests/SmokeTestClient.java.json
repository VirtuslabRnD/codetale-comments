        "body" : "For 2.0, I had to make a few changes to the app:\r\n1. Convert the \"Duration\" APIs to the equivalent \"long\" or \"TimeUnit\" APIs in 2.0\r\n2. Drop the suppress/grace/retention features. This technically breaks the application upgrade, because of the topology numbering clashes, but since we're not verifying the results, the tests pass anyway. Realistically, a real person would do the upgrade first and then add suppression in a separate upgrade, in conjunction with an app reset. Or, following the upgrade guide, they would name the suppression nodes. I'd like to defer simulating this until we add validation to this test. Since it passes right now anyway, there's really no way to tell if any further compatibility work I might do now is actually functioning properly.",
