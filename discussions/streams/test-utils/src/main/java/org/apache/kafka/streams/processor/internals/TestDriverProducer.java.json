In fact, in TTD we have access to InternalTopologyBuilder accessing it functions (we used to also have a wrapper of InternalTopologyBuilder which we removed later) so I thought that was the agreed pattern.",

If you want me to remove this class and make the method `public` I can do it in a follow up PR. Not sure if we have an agreed pattern, though.",
