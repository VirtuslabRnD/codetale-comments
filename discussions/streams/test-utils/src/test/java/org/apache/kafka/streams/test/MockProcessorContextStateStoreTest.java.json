I wanted to make sure that no matter what kind of stores users select, they'll get well-defined results with the new MockProcessorContext.\r\n\r\nSome store features are well-defined not to be supported (they throw an IllegalArgumentException when you try to enable caching or logging), but all store types should otherwise work.\r\n\r\nHere, we're defining \"work\" as \"`init` doesn't throw an exception\", since this is the main involvement that the context itself has with the store.",
