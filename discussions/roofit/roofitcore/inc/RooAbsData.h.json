My main concern is that it's easy to forget to implement the correct `weightError` overload if the function is not purely virtual, forcing you to override it.\r\n\r\nBut okay, since there is some debate here and it's not really an important point, I'm happy to bring back the dummy function so this PR can be merged quickly to continue the developments on the RooFit data store classes.",
