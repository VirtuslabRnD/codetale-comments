        "body" : "That's true, they don't use any private RooAbsPdf data or functions so the new functions could also go somewhere else.\r\n\r\nHowever, the point of these new functions was not to refactor RooAbsPdf for the sake of making the class less big, but it's reducing code duplication such that the definition of the corrected covariance matrix qualities don't have to be maintained at two separate places. I changed the names as you suggested, but I think we should leave further refactoring for other PRs.",
