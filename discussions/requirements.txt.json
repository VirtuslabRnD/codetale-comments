Besides, we now have a designated location in the tree where the packagers can drop-in libs w/o having to package them separately if they wish so.\r\n\r\nBut I see your point: deb packages infamous for regularly breaking pip and other Python packaging-related things. Ref: https://gist.github.com/tiran/2dec9e03c6f901814f6d1e8dad09528e.\r\n\r\nAnyway... We have to specify what exactly is supported right now, this info gets into the metadata and the packagers are responsible for not breaking stuff. If we say that 0.6.0 is not supported and they ignore the instruction, it's not our fault, is it?",
