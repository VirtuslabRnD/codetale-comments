Writing tests this way would ensure that I can use this project in an es6 environment. Various type definitions have been changed lately to support this style, e.g. https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/blob/types-2.0/object-assign/object-assign-tests.ts. \n\nWhat is the policy of the DT team behind this? Has it changed lately?\n",
