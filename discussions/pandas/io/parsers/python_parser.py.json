I'll check for other formats and add tests for MultiIndex headers with no index.\r\n\r\nI thought I would need to add tests for read_table, and read_fwf, but now I see that pandas doesn't duplicate those redundant tests. Instead, tests/io contains read_csv 653 times, read_table 31 times, and read_fwf 49 times. The tests for read_table and read_fwf are just the minimum required to show that they correctly match read_csv, and read_csv is tested in more detail. So I don't think I should add any more tests for this pull request, but that's just my best guess based on what I see so far in the code. Let me know if there's anything else to improve.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
