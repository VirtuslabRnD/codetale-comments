        "body" : "I think that the only public method of `HTMLFormatter` should be `write_result()`.\r\n\r\nThe other methods are currently a mix of private and public. There does not seem to be any consistency.\r\n\r\nIf `write_tr` should be private, the API change would not be an issue. The `indent_delta` is not left to the default by any calls in the current implementation. `indent_delta=0` would be a cleaner default.\r\n\r\nFollowing on from the discussion regarding making `indent` a stateful entity rather than leaving it as a parameter to individual methods: The `write_tr` method accesses the `bold_rows` instance variable. The value should probably be passed through the method's `nindex_levels` parameter which was probably the intention of adding that parameter to the method.\r\n\r\nThe other HTML formatting methods `write`, `write_th`, `write_td` and `_write_cell` do not access instance variables with the exception that `write` needs access to `elements` which effectively the output buffer.\r\n",
