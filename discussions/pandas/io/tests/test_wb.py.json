But because I think I do, and cause of my note below, I did 37f90b7 instead.\n\nIt will fail consistently, it's just a question of which exception catches it.  Since the messages to both contain the same string, and are both ValueErrors, this test should always \"work\".\n\nThe only thing that would cause the test to stop working would be if WB unretired the indicator or their API changed. \n\nMore Info:\n\nThe indicator is a retired one. If World Bank removed it, from their indicator list, it would get caught at line 161 (all indicators failed), rather than where it gets caught now at 201 (single indicator query failure).\n",
