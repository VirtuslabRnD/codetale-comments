Seems though that there might be bigger questions beyond just a simple typo fix (for better or worse) ðŸ˜„ \r\n\r\nThough FYI, given how trivial the change is, you can also add `[ci skip]` to messages of commits like these to avoid triggering builds that should most certainly pass.\r\n\r\n@jreback : Is there any reason that this is implemented (not required from super-class)?\r\n\r\nI don't see it used anywhere by `IntIndex`, and the implementation is just `pass` even though the documentation (grammar error notwithstanding) says it should do something.\r\n\r\nIf it is supposed to be used, should we move this method to the `SparseIndex` class (common method among the two sub-classes in that file)?",
