Would it be better to leave that way so all the Index subclasses are in one place and treated the same way rather than separating 352-353 into its own test? E.g. it was because I didn't see TimedeltaIndex in the dict in TestIndex that I added it (and, in turn, found out that TimedeltaIndex was broken).\r\n\r\nPeriodIndex worked before (and was tested, see line 334) but the Period object itself couldn't be serialized (#13463). That's being explicitly tested here at line 321 (serialization of Period and Interval).",
