        "body" : "I think the confounding thing here is that not having fsspec installed breaks a test, and not the actual feature being tested (pandas could set custom http headers on a FastParquet file request and parse it without fsspec being installed).  The fsspec package is only needed in the case of testing FastParquet because it won't write to a BytesIO or filelike object without being patched.  I didn't importorskip in the class definition because it's outside of a test, and used inside a test.  I don't know if that helped explain it or made it less clear.  If you'd rather it be done another way, that's all good just let me know!",
