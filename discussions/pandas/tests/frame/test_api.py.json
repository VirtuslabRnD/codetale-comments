Obviously changing comments isn't going to affect any of the code base but it still makes the diffs of your PRs unnecessarily larger, which makes reviews more difficult.\r\n\r\nYou should always look for logical separation points for smaller PRs, i.e. if you really want to clean up these comments then make a separate PR for that rather than bundling here. For this change please revert this file to master",
