        "body" : "As a minor detail I had to modify the signature of this which previously accepted a PyObject and perform a `PyDateTime_Check` call. The problem with moving that into a separate file is that you need to call `PyDateTime_IMPORT` to set an object with static duration in this file separate from what is already in `objToJSON.c` and there's not a great place to really set that. \r\n\r\nWe didn't explicitly do anything with the check previously and this aligns better with `PyDateTimeToIso` so I think not a big deal",
