        "body" : "@TomAugspurger Yes, the reason for this is that `pytz` generates a separate `tzinfo` object for each unique offset/tzname combination, and that is what is attached when you call `.localize` or `.normalize`. These time zones don't compare equal to one another.\r\n\r\nIt might be worth noting that this function exists only to add a notion of equality to `pytz`-style zones that is compatible with the notion of equality expected of `tzinfo` subclasses.",

Even though `pytz.timezone(US/Eastern)` and `pytz.timezone(America/New_York)` always generate the same exact rules, they will be treated as different zones for purposes of `tz_compare` (which also means `concat` will merge them and convert to UTC).",
