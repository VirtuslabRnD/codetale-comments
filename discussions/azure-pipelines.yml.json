IMO, this should have been considered in a separate PR.\r\n\r\nAlso, as your changes did not actually modify any Python benchmark code, it was not possible to review how it would look in the Azure logs.  This log here from another PR (#23752) is unfortunately impossible to read:\r\n\r\nhttps://dev.azure.com/pandas-dev/pandas/_build/results?buildId=4580",

We often ask people to run `asv` whenever there are changes to C and Cython code in general, just to make sure that no benchmarks were affected as a result of the changes.",

They are two semantically different things, and the separation would allow us to provide more semantically clear display names such as \"Doctests\" and \"Linting\" instead of the slightly vaguer mashup of \"Checks_and_doc\".",
