        "body" : "You do not have to - it's the recommended version of dependencies. This is just a hint that you can do it. I proposed to have \"apache-airflow-pinned\" package release separately. with clear purpose in mind \"to have repeatable installation\"\r\n\r\nI agreed  having the --constraint and having to know which version to install might be confusing - that was my point in the discussion - but there are different opinions. For now I just want to merge requirements.txt and it's maintenance mechanism so that we avoid further breakage. But the discussion continues here how to approach it:\r\n\r\nhttps://lists.apache.org/thread.html/rf8b0ea9a7b93482734ae9e10e7d87f3c31679edb5eaf88496e733aa5%40%3Cdev.airflow.apache.org%3E\r\n\r\nI invite you to take part in the discussion and propose some solutions/approach. I would really love to have yours (and others) opinions in the thread there. \r\n",
