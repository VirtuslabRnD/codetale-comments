Often with `cmake`, `ctest` can be called instead of some `make` testing command. After looking through this it appears `make test` is the way to go. Also, would be nice to have a call to `make` in here to. So, it would be good if we could have something like this.\n\n```\ncmake <blah>\nmake\nmake test\nmake install\n```\n",

In addition, the tests were pulling down data to test on. However, the code doing this (not distributed) was written in Python and was Python 2.x compatible only. To get all of this to work we would have to patch out all these cases and fix their scripts, which begins to question the value of running the tests at all.\n",
