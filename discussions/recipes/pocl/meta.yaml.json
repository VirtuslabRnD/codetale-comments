I'm happy to revert to zero if you think that starting at zero is the overriding concern, but overall I thought, \"it's just a number\", and figured obvious upgrade behavior from the out-of-tree package was more important than clean numbering. Let me know if you feel strongly about this, I'll revert if you prefer.",
