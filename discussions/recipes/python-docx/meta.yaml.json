MIT is definitely one of these licenses. To do this for `python-docx`, it is simply a matter of adding the following.\n\n```\n  license_file: LICENSE\n```\n\nIt would be nice to have this done in the feedstock with a corresponding build number bump. That way new packages will include the license and thus be compliant.\n",
