Fortunately, it isn't too bad to copy things over.\n\nI manually inspected what got built by forcing a failure at the end of the `make check` step and this is what I found to be useful. The rest is `*.o` files, `*.cc` files, and `*.h` files (that appeared useful for the build only not as external API).\n",
