        "body" : "@pelson we have two issue on OS X.\n- Python 2.7: downloads the most up-to-date `hdf5` and crashes due to a mismatch with `libnetcdf`. I am not sure if that is a bad pinning on our part or the same `conda-build` bug we experienced in RIOS. (Which I believe has a fix in the next relese.)\n- Python 3: [`ImportError: No module named 'iris.fileformats._pyke_rules.compiled_krb'`](https://github.com/conda-forge/staged-recipes/pull/280#issuecomment-206377121)\n\nI can confirm that adding the proper `hdf5` in the build requirements the first one, but I don't want to do that as it is a hack. The second one I have no idea. That is why I am skipping OS X here. If you are OK with that let's merge and fix that in the feedstock.\n",
