I was meaning to come back and respond to your more recent comment.\n\nThat is the moral of the story though. This option is key to having a performant and portable version of OpenBLAS. This has worked very nicely in my experience. The net effect is a BLAS that has fast, portable, and has very permissive licensing so it can be used with GPL'd code if needed. My understanding of MKL is the latter is not possible, but IANAL.\n",
