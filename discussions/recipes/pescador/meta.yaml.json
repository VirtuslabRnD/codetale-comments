In lieu of having the license file available when the conda package is built the request is usually   \r\n\r\n(1) add a MANIFEST.in to the python package upstream and note that this was done so that when the conda package is built for that version, we can include the license with the conda package or  \r\n\r\n(2) include the license in the recipe directory [like this](https://github.com/conda-forge/staged-recipes/pull/2689/commits/10c83cbb29211dedcab4269ae16a1e34543e3fdd#diff-9e023f20b425c0bdb974c3812be0b592R31).  \r\n\r\nFWICT this is more of a suggestion than a **YOU MUST DO THIS** :smile:. Up to you on this. If you'd prefer to do neither of those things, then :+1: from me",
