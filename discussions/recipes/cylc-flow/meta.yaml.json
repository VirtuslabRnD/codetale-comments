        "body" : "Oh, one of the DevOps CI builds implied that the ``cylc`` command could not be imported, & looking at a selection of other recipes under ``conda-forge/feedstocks`` commands from the package module itself were not used, so I thought I would see what happened without this for debugging, after which I could re-add it. (I did not think you would be awake at this late NZ hour, but planned to sanity check the change with you afterwards!)\r\n\r\nIt looks like we pass all checks without that metadata item, so I'll now add it back in & hopefully it will all still work (it may have just been failing due to trying to build for Windows).",
