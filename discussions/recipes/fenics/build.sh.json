I tried making the 'main' source the dolfin repo, but since it contains LFS files, conda-build can't clone repos with LFS files right now (https://github.com/conda/conda-build/issues/1462).\n\nI asked @jakirkham about multiple sources, and he said that running git in build.sh was ~the only option for now while we wait for conda-build to support multiple sources (https://github.com/conda/conda-build/issues/1466).\n",
