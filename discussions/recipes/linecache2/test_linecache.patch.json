Yeah - that's taken from the patch mentioned in [this comment](https://github.com/testing-cabal/linecache2/issues/2#issuecomment-176871454) That patch was applied to a different commit than the current one in the base repo, so I ported those changes into a new file. That could hasn't been thoroughly reviewed; rather, I was trusting that the various adaptations were indeed necessary for providing tests missing from the original. The fact that the original patches weren't sufficient surprised me, and resulted in the commenting spree in `test_linecache.py`\n\nSo: before passing this on to upstream we should establish that everything in the`inspect_fodder.py` patch is still essential to the build.\n",
