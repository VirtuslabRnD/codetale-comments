        "body" : "Looking at the `setup.py` file, there are two \"extra\" dependencies: \n- PyOpenSSL to support ftps. This library is available via the `default` channel, so it seems sensible to include it. \n- pysendfile to speed up uploads on posix for speeding up uploads for python <3.3. This is not on `defaults` or `conda-forge`, so I'm less inclined to add it at this point (but maybe it could be added in the feedstock once a conda-forge recipe is added).  \n",

In this case it would only make sense to add the dependency for py 2.7, however, I'm not a huge fan of having libraries too different from each other (py 3 and py 2).\n",

The supported platforms are:\n> - Linux\n> - Mac OSX\n> - FreeBSD\n> - Dragon Fly BSD\n> - Sun OS\n> - AIX (not properly tested)\n\nSo no windows there, nor Python 3.5.\n",
