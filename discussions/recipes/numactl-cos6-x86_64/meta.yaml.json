If they claim it is GPL, but don't provide the license, they are effectively breaking the license they claim to have.  In fact, claiming to be GPL but not having a license file would mean that the package is still under right of first publish.",

One thing that sticks out to me are [these lines]( https://github.com/numactl/numactl/blob/1959c774398fa6859ff98dde76c01c7579be2731/numa.h#L13-L15 ).",

They are saying we should use GPL 2.0 license and we don't need to distribute the copyright notice with the conda package, but with GPL we are saying we'll provide the source which has the copyright notice if somebody asks.\r\n\r\nWe do this for many GPLed R packages. For eg: https://github.com/conda-forge/r-pvclust-feedstock/blob/4c0a4d0c30d02e8e5068cb0767bf752af12acd14/recipe/meta.yaml#L44\r\nWe don't do it for BSD licensed R packages, because the license text for BSD require the distribution of the copyright notice.",

I've included the copyright section that @isuruf pointed to. Also have included copies of the GPL 2 and LGPL 2.1 license files. (BTW thanks for getting this fixed in conda-build @isuruf! ðŸ˜„)\r\n\r\nThe man pages also have license headers that include what is referred to as [the \"verbatim\" license]( https://www.kernel.org/doc/man-pages/licenses.html#verbatim ). I haven't packaged this additionally as the man pages already include it.\r\n\r\nAlso the copyright refers to `numademo` having special conditions and the header of the source file should be inspected. However looking at `numademo`, it appears [this is just under GPL2]( https://github.com/numactl/numactl/blob/e7bc3059e189709aba48fc5945215ec2a902adf2/numademo.c#L7-L10 ) like the rest of the `numactl` (non-`libnuma`) bits. So didn't do anything special for it either.\r\n\r\nI hope that sufficiently addresses the license packaging with these CDTs. Please let me know if you have other questions.",
