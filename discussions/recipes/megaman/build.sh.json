There has been some brief discussion about taking a newer `clang` system compiler for OS X (that has OpenMP support) and compiling it on an old OS X (Apple provides the source code) so that we can remain compatible on old systems, but supply the latest features. A similar strategy is already being pursued on Linux. If we do this, we may not require `gcc` for these situations in the future. Actually, the only required thing from the GCC toolkit will be `gfortran` if we have Fortran code.\n",
