There may be a way around this but my hope is that it is acceptable to do these tests during the \"build\" phase.",

(might need to be `${CONDA_PREFIX}`)\r\n\r\n(It's not essential, just a suggestion for how you could do it.)",

I agree that it would be better to test with the include files once they're moved to the install location but I don't think doing these particular tests with the include files in `source_files` would really test that so I would prefer to leave it as is.",
