        "body" : "I'm pretty comfortable with this set of tests.\n\nA lot of these entry points require the use of Pyro, and many of the\nscripts generate errors when Pyro is not installed. However, I do not want\nto treat Pyro as a required dependency for Pyomo.  In practice, it is not\nrequired.\n\nI've highlighted this behavior for the Pyomo developer team, and it'll be\nfixed during the next major release.  But IMO this isn't a reason to hold\nup the release.\n\nPyomo is extensively tested, though the tests aren't publicly available.\nThe project is moving to github shortly, so there will be publicly\navailable tests in future releases as well.\n\nOn Tue, Apr 26, 2016 at 9:15 PM, jakirkham notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> In recipes/pyomo/meta.yaml\n> https://github.com/conda-forge/staged-recipes/pull/449#discussion_r61190815\n> :\n> \n> > -    - pyomo.util\n> > -    - pyomo.util.tests\n> > -    - pyomo.version\n> > -    - pyomo.version.tests\n> >   +\n> > -  commands:\n> > -    - runbenders --help\n> > -    - evaluate_xhat --help\n> > -    - runph --help\n> > -    - runef --help\n> > -    - pysp2smps --help\n> > -    - phsolverserver --help\n> > -    - scenariotreeserver --help\n> > -    - computeconf --help\n> > -    - test.pyomo --help\n> > -    - pyomo --help\n> \n> Maybe we should test more of the entrypoints above.
