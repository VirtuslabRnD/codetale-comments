How's this:\r\n- I went to the CRAN bookdown page, https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/bookdown/index.html\r\n- I followed the GPL-3 link given for License on that page\r\n- I copied the License text in that link into a file LICENSE.txt that I placed in the recipe directory\r\n- I cite this file in the meta.yaml under 'about:' as follows:\r\nlicense_file: '{{ environ[\"RECIPE_DIR\"] }}/LICENSE.txt'\r\nWill this suffice?\r\nThanks,\r\nBengt",
