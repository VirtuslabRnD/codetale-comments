        "body" : "> given that we need cython at runtime, do we also need compilers at runtime?\r\n\r\ngood point! It always worked fine on the test servers because they have system-wide installs of the necessary compilers, but it definitely makes sense to use the conda framework here as well.\r\n\r\nI also noticed that my test would have actually passed even if runtime compilation with Cython failed, because we have a fallback solution with numpy in place (it would raise a warning but would not fail). I now explicitly ask for Cython which will raise an error if the compilation is not successful. Because things became too long for a single `python -c` line, the test is now in `run_test.py`.",
