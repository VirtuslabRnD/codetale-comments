        "body" : "For creating new environments this will work fine.\r\n\r\nThe issue arises when someone installs `pywr` into a pre-existing environment which contains old versions of these packages. If no versions are specified the packages won't be updated as conda thinks any version of `matplotlib`/`jupyter`/... is appropriate. This will also affect installing with pip.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion the best solution is to use two jobs in your CI, one tests the latest releases and one tests the minimum supported versions. You can then adjust the minimum versions when the CI fails or modify the code to avoid the issue.\r\n\r\n> One or two could be considered optional dependencies I guess, how should those be dealt with here?\r\n\r\nThey can be listed as \"required\" dependencies if you want them to be installed by default.",
