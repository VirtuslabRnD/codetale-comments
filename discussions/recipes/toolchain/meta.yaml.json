        "body" : "> Got it, still learning the wily ways of conda.\n\nThat's a pretty new addition though so I'm not sure how many people are aware of it.\n\n> Is there a canonical way we can start capturing and documenting best practices?\n\nWe have been trying to document some things like this in the [wiki](https://github.com/conda-forge/staged-recipes/wiki). Though it certainly could use some more love. Right now it is mainly Windows tricks, pinning, and a few links.\n\nAlso, we have [guidelines](https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge.github.io/blob/2a508a065c3316c42df01775553c40d2e21baa14/docs/guidelines.md) for additions. We are working on a PR template for staged-recipes ( https://github.com/conda-forge/staged-recipes/pull/550 ).\n\nOne of the big things we have been trying to do of late is absorb some of the repetitive practices into a package like this one or this other one for Windows ( https://github.com/conda-forge/staged-recipes/pull/617 ). There is also an ongoing discussion in this issue ( https://github.com/conda-forge/staged-recipes/issues/535 ) about absorbing boilerplate in different ways.\n\n> I find the conda documentation lacking (I mean, obviously one could submit conda PRs, but I'm talking about more a cookbook for common scenarios).\n\nThat doesn't hurt either. The conda docs live in this [repo](https://github.com/conda/conda-docs). There is also a conda [wiki](https://github.com/conda/conda/wiki), which can be nice. Also, conda-build has its own [wiki](https://github.com/conda/conda-build/wiki). Though that seems mainly to have ideas about Windows.\n",
