Personally, I try to keep my environment super pristine. There are just way too many things environment variables affect. Besides, as an end user, I think it is much easier to solve this scenario, \"Oh, apparently this isn't set. Let's set it.\", than this one, \"It does appear to be set. What is wrong with it?\".\n\nIn the future, we certainly can discuss storing the pre-activation environment variables somewhere else and then reloading them during post-activation.\n",

We aren't changing the environment of the process that actually called `conda build recipe`, just the environment within the conda-build subprocess call. No?\n",
