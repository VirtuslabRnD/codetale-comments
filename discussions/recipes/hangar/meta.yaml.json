You can introduce a constraint on the Python version without by putting `python >=3.6` and conda won't try to install it.\r\n\r\nIn general pure Python packages can be noarch but anything with compiled code can't as different binary formats are used on different platforms and the Python ABI changes between versions.\r\n\r\nThat said, a limitation of the current conda package format is that `noarch` packages have to always have the same dependencies so the `blosc-hdf5-plugin  # [not win]` line means this can't be made `noarch`.\r\n",

        "body" : "So the `blosc-hdf5-plugin` library isn't a hard dependency for this project. It's just an optional package which mildly increases IO performance of compressed data.\r\n\r\nIt's actually a pretty huge achievement to make the `hdf5 blosc` filter available for Unix-like platforms alone. The `hdf5` plugin build/distribution/install system is fairly convoluted, and I'm not actively versed in its workings right now. It would take more time than I have right now to hack a window build script together. It might move up on my priority list in the future, but right now It's not feasible.\r\n\r\nSince it's a totally optional package, i'm not worried about it being a major issue for distributing `Hangar` via `conda-forge`. \r\n\r\nHopefully this is ok?
