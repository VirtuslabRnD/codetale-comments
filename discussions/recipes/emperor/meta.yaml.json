However this version is useful as is, and is the version we have released over at [biocore](https://anaconda.org/biocore/emperor) (this is the version we recommend our users install for the time being, see this [link](https://github.com/biocore/emperor/blob/new-api/INSTALL.md), as a developer keeping everything in conda-forge would make the release process a lot simpler).\n\nI also understand that, pre-releases are not quite supported by this infrastructure, so I'm not sure what is the best path moving forward.\n",
