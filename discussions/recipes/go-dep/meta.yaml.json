Not really trying to suggest how it should be solved with Go.\r\n\r\nMore mentioning this as it seems we are developing a templating framework here for Go packages and wanted to get a sense to what extent this is needed/will be used in the future. Probably worth mentioning your thoughts on prefixing with Go packages somewhere with higher visibility like the webpage repo to get feedback from others.",

Could you please raise an issue about this on the conda-forge `libarchive` feedstock?",
