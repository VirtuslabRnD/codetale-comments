I am OK with 1-2 different forms for `script`. And, if anyone is found broken, we have to fix it. Right now we know that `pip` is not.\n\n> No one wants broken packages.\n\nAgreed!\n",

To me, installation is the most important part. The rest is basically metadata. 😉 \n\n> ...and we already merged feedstocks with that syntax. So I think this ship has sailed.\n\nPerhaps it comes across as I'm being too much of a stickler here. Maybe if it were just that syntax, I might not balk so much. Though we have pip installs that [don't use `--no-deps`](https://github.com/conda-forge/vcversioner-feedstock/blob/d04fb486630944675739278056f64fce3edbc434/recipe/meta.yaml#L14) and here's [another](https://github.com/conda-forge/jsonschema-feedstock/blob/master/recipe/meta.yaml#L14). This [one](https://github.com/conda-forge/ipython-feedstock/blob/master/recipe/meta.yaml#L13) matches 4, which can have some [surprising effects](https://github.com/conda-forge/staged-recipes/issues/528#issuecomment-216828570). We really need a standard like yesterday and we need to stick with it. Also, we can't be allowing things in because we did it before as there are many wrong things we did before that are out in the wild.\n\nSorry if this comes off as strong, it is merely a reflection of my concern for the current situation with these `script` lines.\n",
