Make it easy to update.\n2. Be a building block for new recipes.\n\nVersion helps 1. Checksum has some small value by making it easier to update at the top. So we have become ok with it. Name doesn't matter for 1, but helps 2. However, having it in the URL the way it is now doesn't help 1 or 2. For 1 the URL has to be removed anyway. For 2 it doesn't provide any advantage that hard-coding doesn't already satisfy. As mentioned, it already makes that URL a little bit unclear, but as it doesn't offer anything in exchange it should be dropped.\n",
