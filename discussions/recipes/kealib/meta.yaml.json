        "body" : "We cannot remove the `hdf5` pin. We need `hdf5 1.8.15*` instead of `1.8.16*` to be compatible with the `default` channel `libnetcdf`. We will be able to upgrade only when we have our own `libnetcdf` compiled against `hdf5 1.8.16` and we are sure users won't be mixing default channel packages with conda-forge packages. (The latter we can never really know, but we can provide the majority of the packages compiled against our `hdf5`).\n\nPS: What @pelson meant is to pin to `1.8.15*` instead of the exact version of `1.8.15.1` to avoid the maintenance burden in case new versions on the `1.8.15.x` series pop up.\n",

As soon as we merge https://github.com/conda-forge/staged-recipes/pull/378 and https://github.com/conda-forge/staged-recipes/pull/213 we re-built everything against `hdf5 1.8.16`.\n",
