This is typical.\r\n\r\nWhat is worth noting is that VS 2015 32-bit builds fail. This [log]( https://ci.appveyor.com/project/conda-forge/staged-recipes/build/1.0.14805/job/rlmkrvh1dr42rf20#L436 ) demonstrates the build failure. An issue has already been raised about this upstream. ( https://github.com/clMathLibraries/clRNG/issues/11 ) As there doesn't seem to be a patch we can use to fix this, we merely disable those builds. VS 2015 64-bit builds seem to build fine.",
