        "body" : "Yeah the ImageMagick feedstocks is a bit outdated it seems then. These flags are included in our legacy and new toolchains. So all of these can be dropped in the feedstock. This includes the `if`/`elif` below as well.\r\n\r\nAlso the `.la` (libtool archive) file removal is handled by `conda-build` directly. The fixes for this below preceded that release and can be dropped too.\r\n\r\nHopefully this simplifies things for you a bit going forward. :)",
