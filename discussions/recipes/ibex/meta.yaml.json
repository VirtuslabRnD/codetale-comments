        "body" : "I believe that supporting py2 would require the use of selectors which would preclude the use of `noarch: python`. Since no one is clamouring for a py2 conda package I applied the YAGNI principle.\r\n\r\nI'm happy for a maintainer to step up and fix the recipe to also support py2 and if a user actually pops up requesting it I can look into it myself then. In the meantime I think it's fine putting less strain on the CI system until demand for py2 support actually materialises.",
