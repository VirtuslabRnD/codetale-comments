        "body" : "I agree with everything that has been said so far:\r\n\r\n1. This license is more restrictive than most users would expect. From my reading, even if the commercial product makes the source code openly available (e.g. as required by a copyleft style license), they still have to obtain permission first from ACM.\r\n1. conda-forge is not violating the license because we are not including it in a commercial product, and we are including the license with the distributed binary.\r\n1. The point of including the license information with the conda recipe and conda binary is so that end users can decide if the software license is appropriate for their use case.\r\n1. Most end users are unlikely to check the licenses of every dependency (but also most users are not creating a commerical product, and those that are should seek legal counsel)\r\n1. Unfortunately none of us our lawyers...\r\n\r\nI investigated the packages that have akima as a dependency. There are 4 CRAN packages (DATforDCEMRI, FGN, RchivalTag, spikeSlabGAM), and although they don't state anything about the ACM license, they are all CC BY-NC-SA (i.e. non-commercial, so that is somewhat compliant).\r\n\r\nThere are 3 Bioconductor packages (LedPred, OCplus, splatter). These are much more troublesome. LedPred is MIT, OCplus is LGPL, and splatter is GPL3. From my understanding, all 3 packages are violating the terms of the ACM license by stating their packages are available under these open source licenses.",
