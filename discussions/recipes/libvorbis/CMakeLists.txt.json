For future versions of this package, I will use the CMakeLists.txt supplied by the package, but for this version I will stick with the one I wrote, if that's ok, because I've tested it to work on all platforms, AND it is already largely based on their version at this point, so it shouldn't cause many problems if I swap my version with theirs in the future, once they start including it in their release tarballs. \r\nAdditionally, their CMakeLists.txt file currently depends on files that also have not been included in any of the official releases, or have been renamed (for instance configure.ac -> configure.in), so if I simply copy their CMakeLists.txt into the recipe, it causes crashes because of this.",
