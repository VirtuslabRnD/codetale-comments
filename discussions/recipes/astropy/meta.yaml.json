Could also have a `license_family` field that would be basically like this one. Finally packaging the license in the conda package has become a good practice as many licenses have a clause requiring it. Also it can be handy for the end user to reference. This can be done by adding `license_file: licenses/LICENSE.rst` to pick it up from the source.",
