I think it is better to leave it up to the user to include the libraries they think to need.\r\nMoreover, I compiled sdl2_mixer against the static audio libraries, and as far as my limited C compilation knowledge goes, this means that you don't need the {dlls|dylibs|so} of these libraries, but that they are (partly) included in the sdl2_mixer module itself. Correct me if I'm wrong.",

However, since the build/configure script looks for these libraries, I thought it was smarter to include them at build time, even though I don't know if it has any benefits/consequences for the resulting build.\r\n\r\nOn Windows on the other hand, it can be more difficult because sdl2_mixer doesn't always look for the libraries at the correct places. I was advised to compile sdl2_mixer against the static libraries, as I do here. And, as far as I know, sdl2_mixer first tries to look for and use the dynamic libraries and uses these statically linked libraries as a fallback if it can't find them.\r\n\r\nEDIT: mean fallback instead of callback of course.",
