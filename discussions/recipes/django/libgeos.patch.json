We hardcode the conda c-lib path. that will break the package for any other c-lib, but ensures it always works with the one declared in the recipe dependencies.\n\nThis seems to work.  There are a few failures due to some dependencies that did not land on the channel yet.  I will finish this tomorrow.\n",
