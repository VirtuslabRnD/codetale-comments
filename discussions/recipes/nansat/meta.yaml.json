It is possible that we could build it with these, but run it with a newer version, but that has not been tested thoroughly. ",

But I am testing to run them now with the latest version of these libraries, while still building with the strict requirements.\r\n\r\nThe problem I foresee is if there is something in a new release that breaks backward compatibility. I assume the feedstock for Nansat will not rebuild each time a dependency has updated, hence nosetests will not be tested for each new dependency update.\r\n\r\nDo you not think this can be a possible issue?\r\n\r\nedit: my initial tests show that we can not run with the latest scipy at least.",
