You could probably even just drop it into that thread. Here is their [mailing list](http://lists.maptools.org/mailman/listinfo/tiff) sign up page.\n",

I guess if you're worried about it, leave it out and see what happens.  I think you run into either duplicate definition of snprintf or lack of it, depending on the compiler you're using.\n",
