        "body" : "So the license for 4.0.3 appears to be pretty terrible and not at all GPL. Basically it can only be used by non-profits and US government agencies only for research and educational usage. Others can evaluate it, but not depend on it.\n\nThere is also some question as to whether we can distribute it. See this line below copied from the license. We certainly are not selling it, but we may be distributing it depending on how they chose to define that. Not sure how SuiteSparse handled this issue (perhaps just by making it optional).\n\n>  One may make copies of the software for their use provided that the copies, are not sold or distributed, are used under the same terms and conditions.\n\nHave quoted the rest of the license below so that it can be seen.\n\n```\nThe METIS package is copyrighted by the Regents of the University of\nMinnesota.
