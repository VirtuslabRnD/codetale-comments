It was a BSD 3-Clause license with an additional (not advertising) clause similar in form (not necessarily meaning) to the HDF5 license. Though there are parts under other licenses like PSF 2 and some BSD like license for Unicode stuff. We could list those out, but \"BSD Like\" seems sufficient to cover those generally (at least to me).\n\nWe could ask others if they have a preference.\n",
