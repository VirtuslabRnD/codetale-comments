When I said \"no-ops\", I just meant that it doesn't execute any additional code. Some python packages import submodules in the package's primary `__init__`, so you end up initiating a bunch of imports of dependencies throughout the package. Either way of setting things up is fine, you just have to be careful since the simple import test in the `meta.yaml` doesn't tell you much out than the package exists. ",
