        "body" : "I have to admit the constellation is a little odd and I should have explained from the beginning.\r\n\r\nSo the latest release of the [`configobj`](https://github.com/DiffSK/configobj) package on PyPI is from 2014. Since then, numerous important fixes have been added to its development branch, but the maintainers have been unable to draft a new release (it's been promised for over 3 years now). Besides, the latest release on PyPI is broken and deviates from the release on GitHub with the same version number. See e.g. https://github.com/DiffSK/configobj/issues/160\r\n\r\nThis mess forces many users to use the GitHub `master` branch instead, which is less than optimal; others even started vendoring patched versions of the code.\r\n\r\nI decided to bite the bullet and \"fork\" the project in the sense that it's a \"packaging fork\": the idea is to stay in sync with upstream, but to release packages to PyPI and `conda-forge` once in the while, at least until the upstream devs start publishing releases again (which may never happen).\r\n\r\nSince the intention (at least so far) is not to extend the functionality of the project, but to simply package more of the recent, but unreleased upstream development efforts, I decided to name the fork `configobj-dev`.\r\n\r\nI acknowledge the whole situation is a little unfortunate, but I trust this package could help many people.",
