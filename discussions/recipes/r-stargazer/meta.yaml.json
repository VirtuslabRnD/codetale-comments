The scripts enable that `noarch: generic` recipes can be built on all arches, even though they are built on linux after feedstock conversion. And yes, often `script: R CMD INSTALL --build .` would be enough, but that would currently be a manual change to the output of `conda_r_skeleton_helper / conda skeleton cran`.",

This seems to a more general discussion about R packages and not specific about this package as we merged a lot of similar recipes in the last weeks. Happy to change it afterwards but I think we should discuss this in an issue in https://github.com/bgruening/conda_r_skeleton_helper",

From a readability from of view I don't like* it but it has a use case.\r\n\r\n* It makes it hard to review a recipe and figure out if it is really `noarch`. That is what just happened here BTW.",
