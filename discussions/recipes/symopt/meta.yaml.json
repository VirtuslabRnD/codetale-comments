        "body" : "Hi Marcelo. The reason for the above arrangement is that one of the available SymPy backends for code generation requires fortran. However, there are other such backends (including the default setting in this package) that do not require fortran. As such, a user could perfectly well install and run this without fortran, but fortran is strictly required to run (all of) tests.\r\n\r\nDoes that make sense?",
