That  version only depended on snappy, that is why I built it with this configuration.\r\n\r\nIf we turn the other backends on, then I think we should build multiple versions of rocksdb and use a _mutex package to select the right backend. Is that how you would do it as well?  If so, let me know and I will add a placeholder _rocksdb_mutex package. \r\n",
