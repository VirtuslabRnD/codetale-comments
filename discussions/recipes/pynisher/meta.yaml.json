Maybe there was a philosophy change. \r\n`Blame` says that it was added here: https://github.com/automl/pynisher/commit/a3e7ccce7b8075b058ae16b9654b91513f9d2037 so it might be good to double-check with the author of the commit.\r\nIn the end, this is only a guess though as I'm not sure if one of these tools was needed at some point and what the philosophy behind adding it was, or if they are used in a context that's not obvious when just examining the repo.",

Maybe there was a philosophy change. \r\n`Blame` says that it was added here: https://github.com/automl/pynisher/commit/a3e7ccce7b8075b058ae16b9654b91513f9d2037 so it might be good to double-check with the author of the commit.\r\nIn the end, this is only a guess though as I'm not sure if one of these tools was needed at some point and what the philosophy behind adding it was, or if they are used in a context that's not obvious when just examining the repo.",
