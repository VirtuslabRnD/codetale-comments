Second is whether `+` is permitted in `conda` package names. Presumably `+` works ok with `conda` as the tests passed. However I'm not sure whether that is allowed in a package name or not (e.g. noted in the docs).\r\n\r\nCurrently the first issue is blocking conversion of this recipe. So we should probably decide how we want to handle that. What are your thoughts on just calling it `mppp`? Given it matches the repo name, maybe this is ok. Do you have other thoughts on naming?",
