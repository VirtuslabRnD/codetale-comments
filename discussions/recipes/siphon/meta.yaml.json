The default channel does that for all package.  It would be done by adding `numpy x.x` as a dependency.  However, that has the downside of bloating the channel, by creating many packages like `pack-py{versions}-np{versions}`, and using more CI time than needed.\n\nBTW the numpy version range is in the CI configuration. See https://github.com/conda-forge/staged-recipes/blob/master/scripts/run_docker_build.sh#L56 for an example.\n",
