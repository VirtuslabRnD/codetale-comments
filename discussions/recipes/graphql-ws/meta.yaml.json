        "body" : "Sorry, forgot to mention it in the comments. The `conda build .` command failed, and in the traceback I found that it was trying to use `pytest-runner`. Once I added it, the `conda build .` command passed. I think it is because of this hard requirement in `setup_requires`: https://github.com/graphql-python/graphql-ws/blob/523dd1516d8709149a475602042d6a3c5eab5a3d/setup.py#L22\r\n\r\nWe had something similar in our first recipe published to Conda Forge, and someone suggested us to load it dynamically only when running `python setup.py test`. But as I am not a maintainer of `graphql-ws`, that would be a bit harder to get done soon I guess.",
