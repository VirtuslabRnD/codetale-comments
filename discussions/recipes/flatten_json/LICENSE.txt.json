It should be automatically included in the release tarballs on PyPI if you edit your `setup.cfg` to include:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[metadata]\r\nlicense_files = LICENSE\r\n```\r\n\r\nSee [here (and the sample project)](https://packaging.python.org/guides/distributing-packages-using-setuptools/#license-txt) for more details.\r\n\r\nDoing this would remove the need to include this file with the recipe and also ensures that the text is always up to date.",
