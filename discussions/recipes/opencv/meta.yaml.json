This file is currently installed, but it installs to this `share` folder. Do we want it there? There doesn't seem to be a standard place to put this stuff? I've also got other packages locally that has installed to places such as `$PREFIX/lib`, `$PREFIX/PACKAGE/lib` and `$PREFIX/cmake`. @jakirkham \n",
