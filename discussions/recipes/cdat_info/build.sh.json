Is it because it does not really have any reason to be as a stand-alone?",

It does seems like it should be its own standalone package though.\r\n\r\n> I'm not sure what your issue against the package is?\r\n\r\nI don't understand the question. My comment is that `cdat_info.py.in` contains a lot of instructions to be in the `build.sh`. If they make sense as a standalone package or as part of the upstream software it would make more sense. If not, then we should add it as a separate file here for maintainability's sake.",
