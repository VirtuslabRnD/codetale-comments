        "body" : "So this is a can of worms. `bokeh` requires `bkcharts`, but `bkcharts` uses `bokeh` throughout. Thus import tests fail without `bokeh`. It seems like `bokeh` will drop `bkcharts` in the long term. Would expect `bkcharts` also starts depending on `bokeh` then. In the interim, this helps us avoid a painful cyclic dependency.\r\n\r\nAlso it seems this won't work with the current `bokeh` in `conda-forge` (0.12.5). So am pinning `bokeh` to 0.12.6.\r\n\r\nxref: https://github.com/bokeh/bkcharts/issues/73",
