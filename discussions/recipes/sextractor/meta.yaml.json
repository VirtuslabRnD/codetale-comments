Breaking backwards compatibility incurs unnecessary friction for what is otherwise a purely additive, positive gain, and also potentially contributes to grumblings & negative sentiment about CoC and DISC matters.\r\n\r\nNot breaking people's workflow - especially, in this case, a non-developer-facing command line tool - is really, really, really important.  (For instance, it's one of Linux Torvald's core principles is \"we don't break userspace\".)",
