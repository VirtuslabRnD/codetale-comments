        "body" : "Nested sampling is a rather theoretical approach - rarely used in practise. Still it is nice for educational purposes. The code is not nice, but it is the best implementation I am aware off. \r\n\r\n**Background:** \r\nAs part of the https://github.com/pyiron project I started to submit a series of materials science codes to conda-forge - the full list is available here https://jan-janssen.github.io/conda-forge-contribution/ . We agreed early on to have the packages in the conda-forge channel, rather than building a separate channel like bioconda. ",

But I agree, most likely it is more reasonable to use one of the mainstream codes and build a materials science specific version on top of it. Still at the moment the pymatnest code is the one used in our specific case. If you say that it does not match the conda-forge quality level that is fine for me, then I move it to a separate channel.
