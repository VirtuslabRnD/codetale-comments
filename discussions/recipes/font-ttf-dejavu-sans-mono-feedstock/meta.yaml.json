Seems like Dejavu fonts are based on multiple previous fonts (all `BSD` licensed) plus the dejavu work on top, which is `public domain`. Now also changed the meta.yaml to `license: Public Domain, BSD-3-Clause`, `license_family: OTHER`. Hope that is more correct. The included LICENSE file is anyway stating this all correct.",
