        "body" : "Just to be clear about a few things, conda-forge allows feedstocks to add back in python 2 support if needed. From https://conda-forge.org/docs/user/announcements.html#announcements : \r\n\r\n> 2020-03-21\r\n> Python 2.7 Admin Command Available\r\n> \r\n> A webservices admin command is now available to add Python 2.7 back to feedstocks. Put `@conda-forge-admin add python 2.7` in the title on an issue in your feedstock. The admin webservices bot will then issue a PR adding back Python 2.7. Note that this PR will remove other Python builds and any win, aarch64, or ppc64le builds. If you want to keep those, merge the PR into a separate branch on your feedstock.\r\n\r\nI just want to make sure this is clear because looking upstream it appears that you dropped python2 support with the changes you made in `1.1.15`, but the meta info in the `setup.py` says that python2 is still supported. You don't have to drop python 2 support in your library to be on conda-forge. Conda-forge just won't build python 2 binaries by default, even if the library still supports python 2 (for users who want to download source code from github as an example). ",

The changes I made are py2/3 compatible (passing tests and I also just tested installing 1.1.15 from my conda channel in a fresh docker py27 miniconda env). If I understand you right then I don't think we need to add special py27 feedstock, since this is noarch build anyways. \r\n\r\nAre there any other changes required to add this to conda-forge?",
