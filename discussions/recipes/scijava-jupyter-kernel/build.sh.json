The thing is for now the Beakerx package is missing a Maven artifact I could use.\r\n\r\nSo I would like to merge it like this to start with. So people can start using the kernel and give me feedback on it.\r\n\r\nThen once the Beakerx project release Maven artifacts (probably in few weeks), I will modify this recipe to remove the manual Beakerx installation.\r\n\r\nHope you understand.",
