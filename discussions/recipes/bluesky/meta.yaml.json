Probably need to do the same for linux since I was defaulting to osx search. I'm guessing there is another package that's missing a py3.5 build on linux. ",

TBH am generally unclear on how `conda-build` interacts with `conda` at that level. Typically we get good hints when trying to construct a bad `conda` environment. So have not understood why we don't get good hints when `conda-build` constructs the `test` environment. If you say it is a `conda` issue, I'll take it at face value. Just pointing out that this is confusing even for someone from the community that is more familiar with these tools.\r\n\r\nIs there an issue we should be adding this to? Don't want to be adding to the noise if you already know of one.\r\n\r\n> Hmm ok. Out of curiosity, why are we running on conda-build 2.18.1 rather than conda-build 3.1.3?\r\n\r\nIt requires upgrading associated infrastructure as well. So it's not as simple as flipping a switch.
