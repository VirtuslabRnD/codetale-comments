The correct MSVC versions are chosen assuming CONDA_PY is correctly set, _without_ it being included. It seems more like a bug in the resolution of which Python is being used, or at least a quirk. I feel like, since there are so many recipes we need to pin to particular compilers, this should be simpler and more 'obvious'.\n\nAlso, adding it to build (and test) still doesn't work ðŸ˜– \n",
