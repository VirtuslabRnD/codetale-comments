        "body" : "Ah ok. The fact that you can build noarch packages was clear. What wasn't obvious was that I could put a constraint on python in `host`/`run` sections, I thought I could only restrict package versions there. Having said that, I'm not sure if there's a way to make that more obvious in the docs. At some point people need to have a minimum amount of knowledge, which I don't have, or be given help by generous people like you, cheers :D",
