It also seems to think the example recipe was modified even though it's not.\r\n\r\nBut otherwise, we do build this as noarch on PyPI and currently on Bioconda. OpenCV is the one tricky dependency because it relies on some external libraries. Not sure if that makes this package not noarch?",

I had included these packages in the build and host requirements because I though OpenCV needed them, but I removed them now because I realized that `yum_requirements.txt` takes care of the runtime requirements for libGL.
