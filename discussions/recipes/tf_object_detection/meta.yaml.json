        "body" : "The `tensorflow` packages on conda-forge are repackage versions of the PyPI wheels provided by Google.  Despite being labeled as `manylinux1` these wheels do not meet the manylinux specification.  Specifically the wheels and conda packages require Ubunutu 16.04 and must be run on a processor with the AVX instruction set.  Therefore they will not work on the CentOS 6 image that is used for building and testing on conda-forge.  More details on this can be found in conda-forge/tensorflow-feedstock#6.  Building Tensorflow from source would produce packages which are compatible with CentOS 6 but this process is very time consuming, see conda-forge/tensorflow-feedstock#69, if anyone wants to work on this help would be appreciated.",
