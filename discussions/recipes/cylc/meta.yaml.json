        "body" : "In theory yes.\r\n\r\nWe want this metapackage to provide everything users need to run a specific version of \"Cylc\". In the past, there was only `cylc`, which is now `cylc-flow`. We decided to match the version of the old package, so the metapackage version matches the `cylc-flow` release, so users are not confused.\r\n\r\nThis version of the Cylc metapackage should include\r\n\r\n- `cylc-flow` with the same version\r\n- `cylc-uiserver-0.1`, which handles GraphQL backend queries, and communication with `cylc-flow`\r\n- `cylc-ui-0.1`, the JS application that initiates the calls\r\n\r\nIf users install everything as pinned above, it should work. If they install `cylc-ui ==0.2`, our next release of the UI, there is no guarantee it will work with the other dependencies. In fact, we know it shouldn't work as 0.2 has WebSockets, that is not implemented in `cylc-uiserver ==0.1`.\r\n\r\nSo for our next Cylc release 8.0a2 we will bump these pinned dependencies accordingly, so that users can `conda install cylc` and have the correct versions in their environments.\r\n\r\nHope that makes sense. This is our first release to Conda, as you can tell from our 0.1 versions, so happy to change it if you have suggestions for other ways to achieve something similar, or if this strict version requirement is an issue.\r\n\r\nThanks!",
