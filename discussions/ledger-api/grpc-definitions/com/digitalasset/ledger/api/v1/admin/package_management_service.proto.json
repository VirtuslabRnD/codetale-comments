AFAIR @mziolekda mentioned this is about where/how the packages were uploaded, e.g., `Uploaded by admin ABC through participant node XYZ on 2019-06-26`.\r\n\r\nIn the ledger API, it is described as `Description provided by the backing participant describing where it got the package from.`\r\n\r\nIn the `WriteService`, it is described as `The description of the packages provided by the participant implementation.`\r\n\r\nThe former description looks more correct, I will update the comment in `WriteService`",
