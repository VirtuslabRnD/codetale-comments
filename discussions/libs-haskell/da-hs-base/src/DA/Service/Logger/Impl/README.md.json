First ask for permissions on \"Logs Viewer\" and \"BigQuery User\" on the `stackdriver-customer-telemetry` project from an administrator.\n\nThen log into [Google Cloud console](https://console.cloud.google.com/). To view live logging click the hamburger icon and select Logging -> Log viewer from the side panel. In the far left dropdown menu below the filter select \"Global\" for the logs to view. This will show you all the logs from the last 30 days.\n\nIf you want to export the logs go to \"BigQuery\" under the hamburger icon then create a new query. This query exports everything for April 2019. "
