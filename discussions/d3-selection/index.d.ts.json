        "body" : "`null` needs to remain part of the `BaseType` for a couple of reasons, most prominently, there are _top-level_ selection methods, which result in the parent element being set to `null`:\r\n\r\nE.g. : `select<GElement extends BaseType, OldDatum>(node: GElement): Selection<GElement, OldDatum, null, undefined>;`\r\n\r\nAlso, it has now become idiomatic to to create a _subselection_ which is empty with `null` elements before performing a first data join (see discussion in [d3-selection Issue 79](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection/issues/79) ). So to stay consistent with this idiomatic use, we have the sub-selection signatures:\r\n```ts\r\n    /**\r\n     * Create an empty sub-selection. Selection.selectAll does affect grouping: The elements in the returned\r\n     * selection are grouped by their corresponding parent node in this selection, the group at the current index will be empty.\r\n     */\r\n    selectAll(): Selection<null, undefined, GElement, Datum>;\r\n    /**\r\n     * Create an empty sub-selection. Selection.selectAll does affect grouping: The elements in the returned\r\n     * selection are grouped by their corresponding parent node in this selection, the group at the current index will be empty.\r\n     */\r\n    selectAll(selector: null): Selection<null, undefined, GElement, Datum>;\r\n    /**\r\n     * Create an empty sub-selection. Selection.selectAll does affect grouping: The elements in the returned\r\n     * selection are grouped by their corresponding parent node in this selection, the group at the current index will be empty.\r\n     */\r\n    selectAll(selector: undefined): Selection<null, undefined, GElement, Datum>;\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo for this reason, `null` should remain in the `BaseType`.\r\n\r\nNote however, that e.g. `d3-drag` and `d3-zoom` have decoupled much stricter base type, I.e. they are currently limited to just `Element`.",
