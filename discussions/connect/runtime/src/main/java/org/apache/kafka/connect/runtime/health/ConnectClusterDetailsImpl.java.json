If we mention that it's explicitly for use in REST extensions, that information may become outdated if/when the class is used elsewhere. There's pretty sufficient detail on the behavior of the class provided in the javadocs for the interface it implements. I don't think there's anything non-obvious that needs to be documented about this class.",

So the presence of javadoc in the interface but not here does not save us the extra hoop. In any case, I mentioned since this is a small PR and I think it's a good practice (that at least I try to follow as much as possible). Not a blocker for this PR. ",
