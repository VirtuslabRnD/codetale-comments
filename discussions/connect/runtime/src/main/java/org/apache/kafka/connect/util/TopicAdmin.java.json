I didn't think about it, but in fact if the user doesn't have permission to create the topic through the CreateTopic API, then they won't be able to use auto-creation either. I think it would be clearer to check topic existence prior to attempting creation. Then if topic creation fails due to a permission error, perhaps we should make the error fatal.\r\n\r\n@rhauch what do you think?",
