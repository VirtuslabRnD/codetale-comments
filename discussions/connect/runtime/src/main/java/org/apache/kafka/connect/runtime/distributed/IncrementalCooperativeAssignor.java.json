What I think is key, is to use `assignments: ` suffix (or similar) in the end. This way you can grep/collect these lines all together focusing on the logger of this class as well (either via log4j or again by grepping). The fact that these assignments (every set) are printed in a separate line makes the lineage of the assignment process easy to follow. I'll review their final message but again, I'm inclined to retain a common substring and have each one in their own line. Rebalancing is happening in certain moments, so there's no significant issue with verbosity here. ",
