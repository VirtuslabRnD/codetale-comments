Might be good to at least capture that decision here, even if it is to leave the methods as abstract.",

        "body" : "Indeed, I though initially about adding `default` methods for these new interface methods, but seems like `put` wouldn't have a reasonable default implementation. Therefore, since we'll need to extend at least one method, to maintain parity across all methods, I'm suggesting skipping defaults here. Upgrading to this version of Connect will require you to extend this interface. ",
