Without the fix in #7097, the listener will get an update with *all 3 task IDs*, and to pass this line would then need to be changed to:\r\n```\r\n        configUpdateListener.onTaskConfigUpdate(Arrays.asList(TASK_IDS.get(2), TASK_IDS.get(0), TASK_IDS.get(1)));\r\n```\r\nHowever, we don't want *all* task IDs to be updated. Instead only want only the task ID(s) for the tasks that were indeed updated. That's why this test case expects that the task config update only includes the one ID of the task that is actually updated (i.e., `TASK_IDS.get(2)`). So as is, this test method will fail unless the fix for #7097 is actually applied.",
