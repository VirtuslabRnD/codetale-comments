The names are not important, so I'll change them back to the same cluster name.\r\n\r\nI actually do prefer how each test fully sets up the cluster builder, in part because some of the information is changed and some isn't. I found it very error prone while I was working on this to reuse a builder and have each test only change *some* of the attributes, or to remember to set the worker props after changing the `workerProps` map.",
