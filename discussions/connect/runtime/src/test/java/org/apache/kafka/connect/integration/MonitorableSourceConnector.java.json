        "body" : "This was added based on an earlier recommendation by @rhauch to show that the primary purpose of this connector is to be used by the Connect framework in AK, but also allow for this connector to be used in other integration tests too. The first version of the javadoc was closer to what you describe but I think I also prefer that now the primary use case is highlighted. Finally, Connect framework is AK and since this is a connector I don't think we risk a lot for this class to be associated with broker testing directly. ",

        "body" : "couple of questions over this connector:\r\n- since this is a \"monitorable\" connector, we'd need to be able to monitor something: for example: when the connector or its tasks come up or how many records the tasks source.\r\n- one of the problems we ran into the sink connector was that it would start syncing records as soon as the first task starts. this became problematic when running multi task tests (and we are trying to get all tasks to read at process a fixed number of records, for example). I understand that we are not sourcing records in the tests in this PR, and therefore those hooks are not in place. but for the sake of completion, we should either put those in place, or mention here (or in a ticket) that this test needs extra retrofitting before it can be used in integration tests that move records around.
