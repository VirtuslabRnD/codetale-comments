What do you think about overloading the `array` and `map` functions and keep the existing naming convention?\r\n```suggestion\r\n    static SchemaBuilder array() {\r\n```\r\nI don't know of a good alternative to `mapWithNullKeys()` and `mapWithNullValues()`, since you can't use the argument list to distinguish these functions. Perhaps you could relax the null checks in the `map(Schema, Schema)` to allow calls like `map(null, schema)` to perform the same job as `mapWithNullKeys(schema)`.",

        "body" : "This part is slightly hacky since the `SchemaBuilder` is part of the public API. You'll notice the additional methods here are package-private, which is intentional in order to avoid altering the public API. As a result, I also think the method names matter slightly less than they might normally, and the additional `mapWithNullKeys` and `mapWithNullValues` methods are better left as separate methods instead of folding that functionality into the existing `map` method.\r\nAlso, in the event that we want to add an `array()` or a `map()` method as part of the public API in the future that does something else, it seems better to make these internal methods more specific so as to be less likely to pollute that namespace.",
