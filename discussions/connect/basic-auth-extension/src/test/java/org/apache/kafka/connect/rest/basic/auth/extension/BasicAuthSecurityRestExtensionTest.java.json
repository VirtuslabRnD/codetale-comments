        "body" : "Another way is to use a mocked supplier and verify that the methods you expect to be called are indeed called (obviously only `get` here) and return or throw as you expect. This test does that, but with an additional level for indirection with this boolean, which basically implements what Easymock does already. Probably fine here since it results in more condensed code. But in the general case you'd pass a mock to verify that methods on that mock are called, which I also assume is referred to as evaluation here.",
