        "body" : "This portion is pretty similar to what it used to be, but it does raise a few questions, so clarifications could be useful. It used to reference `TensorRT 3.0.4`, which could be beneficial if an exact version is necessary. At the same time, the `NVIDIA Developer website` points you to `TensorRT 5` (is that supported yet?), and the `TensorFlow GPU support` page has a command to install `libnvinfer4=4.1.2-1+cuda9.0`.\r\n\r\nI don't know where the definitive version should be documented, but right now it's a little unclear what is necessary as a user - If I try to follow these instructions directly, I'll end up with TensorRT 5 in addition to `libnvinfer4`, which doesn't seem like an ideal setup. If the `sudo apt install libnvinfer4=4.1.2-1+cuda9.0` gives me all the dependencies I need for this, I think linking to the `TensorFlow GPU support` as the primary resource would be the most intuitive, while the NVIDIA site could be supplementary.\r\n\r\nAgain, this PR doesn't change these instructions much, so this could be clarified outside of this PR, but as a user who has ran into confusion on this, some clarifications in the docs would be appreciated!",
