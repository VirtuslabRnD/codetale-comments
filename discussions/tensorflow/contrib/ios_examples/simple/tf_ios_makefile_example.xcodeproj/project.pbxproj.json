I found I hit problems when trying it with the actual app though, but I'm guessing since it's only a small amount of code it wouldn't make a massive difference. Disabling exceptions on TF and protobuf did help a lot though.\n\nThanks for the comment though, I'd forgotten that RTTI was separate from exceptions, so I can try disabling that too!\n",
