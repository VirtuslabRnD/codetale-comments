        "body" : "We have not yet root-cause analysis of why these tests are failing on the rocm side. They showed up as regressions, when we did a (upstream repo ---> rocm fork) sync last week.  They were tagged as no_rocm at that point.\r\n\r\nThere are two processes going on concurrently on the ROCm side. \r\n* One is to get the contents of our fork in sync with the upstream repo. This PR is a part of that process\r\n* At the same time, we are also looking into the existing test failures on the ROCm platform, and fixing them. These failures will be looked at as part of that process. I will post more information once I have it.",
