If you were to use this code on a big-endian architecture, the layout of the encoded bytes would not match the byte layout in memory.\r\n\r\nNot sure what to do here. I suspect for now, leave a // TODO: add big-endian support and move on.\r\n\r\nI suspect to fix this right, we should add logic to perform byteswapping on serialization or deserialization of a half literal.",

I don't know whether you have discovered them, but you can dump computations to disk (TF_XLA_FLAGS=--xla_dump_computations_to=/tmp/somewhere) and there are utilities to visualize and replay dumped computations in tensorflow/compiler/xla/tools. So the potential for the problem is there, at least --- you can copy the dumped computations between machines.\r\n\r\nI agree that it would be nice if protobuf added a 16-bit type, but it won't happen immediately even if they agree.\r\n",
