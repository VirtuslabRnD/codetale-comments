        "body" : "The only reason for having snippet is to allow Java source code to be read from a file instead of inlining it in a C++ string. It is not required, but could be convenient in some cases (in the next PR, you'll see that the Google licence header added to Java source files is in a snippet, so it can be easily found and updated if required).\r\n\r\nThat being said, for testing writing a snippet, we do need to keep it in a file, otherwise the test is obsolete. I think I'll add a new shortcut method in SourceWriter to write a snippet directly, something like `source_writer.Write(snippet)`, it looks clean.",
