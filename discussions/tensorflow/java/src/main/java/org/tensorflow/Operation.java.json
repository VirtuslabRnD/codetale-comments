I think that a `public Output[] outputList(String name)` would be a much better interface for this. Though I realize that doing so will require tweaking the underlying C API and/or JNI code.\r\n\r\nSo no need to change for now, what you have is fine, just making the observation.",

        "body" : "Ok good. Just to explain my thoughts around this a little more, I agree that `outputList(String name)` is a most intuitive API for getting hold on an output list but in fact, since we collect iteratively the outputs of an operation, the use of the index is more useful. For example, if you have three outputs where the last one is a list, you automatically know that it starts from index `2`, and so on. ",
