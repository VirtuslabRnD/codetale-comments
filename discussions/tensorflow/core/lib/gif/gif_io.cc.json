But since matrix math is happening here, and \"optimized\" is in the PR title, just want to point out `Tensor` (based on Eigen) and better yet MKL e.g. [mkl_matmul_op.cc](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/core/kernels/mkl_matmul_op.cc) (which unlike Eigen doesn't appear to be available in TF builds 100% of thte time) just in case you weren't already aware.",
