Seems like using DoResize==true with SampleMode=NEAREST would be wrong.   Or maybe just use DoResize for this choice here, and remove SampleMode for now?\n",

        "body" : "I took the naming from the ResizeNearestNeighbor op, and I've found the separation of the two properties helps keep the code a bit clearer. The existing op does a floorf on the float coordinates to get the sample coordinates, which is the same as the top left sample here, so I believe this is correct. I agree that having untriggered and untested code paths (resize+nearest) is a bad smell though, but I'd prefer to keep the separation if possible.\n",
