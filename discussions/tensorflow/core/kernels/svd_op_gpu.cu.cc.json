It could have been combined into one function with if-statements on which matrix should be transposed.\r\nThere's a tradeoff between two functions for the two cases and one function for both with many if-statements for which matrix to transpose (and whether we need an additional copy of the input matrix).\r\nI doubt that it is worth it.
