        "body" : "I made it like this to have symmetry with the nvidia images. `nvidia` and `nvidia-devel` *need* to be separate because some of the images they install are mutually exclusive. I think it could be confusing if the pattern was different between the CPU and GPU images, although its current state *is* somewhat redundant.\r\n\r\nThat is, the spec definitions would look like this, which would get confusing if I were reading it:\r\n\r\n- cpu-devel:\r\n   - ubuntu\r\n   - ubuntu-devel\r\n   - devel-stuff\r\n- gpu-devel:\r\n   - nvidia-devel\r\n   - devel-stuff\r\n\r\nI think it could go either way, so this could definitely be changed by anyone updating the Dockerfiles later (e.g. it could be `[ubuntu-base, ubuntu-devel, ...]`)",
