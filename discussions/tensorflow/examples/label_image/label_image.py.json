With that, we have more intuitive mapping between C++ and Python than the python code mentioned in the [Inception tutorial](https://tensorflow.org/tutorials/image_recognition/) and could be easier to add visualization or debug code.\r\n\r\nI pushed the patch with README.md is updated.",

I understand you have it in the readme, but having it in the file is much more likely to be found.\r\n\r\nAlso, I do believe your description in the readme is incorrect -- this file will not be installed with the pip package as it is today, I believe. @petewarden I may be wrong about that though.",
