        "body" : "I'm not sure why most of the additions here were made, tbh.\r\n\r\nAll of this with the caveat IANAL and any questions re: licensing are best directed at ASF legal.\r\n\r\nIn many cases, the NOTICE file might be a more appropriate location depending on where the LICENSE actually gets pulled into the binary distribution. This gets confusing because of handling both source and binary distributions. In source distributions, including additional info in the LICENSE file would really only apply to anything *copied* in afaik, since the source distribution doesn't include any of the dependency binaries, i.e. what's under license in that distribution is only our code. (Probably gets messier with top-of-file copyright notices..., and even NOTICE files seem messy because, e.g., Apache explicitly calls them out while other licenses don't)\r\n\r\nIn binary distributions, adding here wouldn't change, for example, whether we *reproduce* the BSD license notice as requested -- either you think it needs to be directly printed (which this doesn't do) or just including the original JARs with their original licenses would be enough since any binary distribution that *includes* the dependencies would have that in the jar (or if they were missing, upstream should fix that). At a bare minimum, we don't currently include nearly all the dependency licenses here and I don't think most Apache projects do. I haven't looked back at the history to understand what triggered people to start including more than the Apache license in this file.\r\n\r\nAgain, IANAL, but it's actually unclear you *really* need anything beyond the raw license given the way source distributions and java binary distributions would work & preserve other contents (modulo uberjar conflicts, which we don't do). I think Apache is the only OSS license where there's a \"readable\" phrase that might complicate things.\r\n\r\nBut IANAL, so probably figuring this out w/ apache legal would give us more confidence in the answer.",

Ultimately they still include the zstd and zstd-jni license files. I think we can probably commit this as is and perhaps file a JIRA to come up with a standardized approach (probably just use the same convention as spark). Does that sound reasonable?",
