This is a public to-be-overridden API that testing frameworks must implement. Currently testing frameworks can have a unique implementation of `Framework` for JVM, JS and Native. If we change that method name, they will need a separate source file for Native.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, Scala.js *cannot* change the name of that method in its API either, since that would be a binary breaking that would break all published testing frameworks, which is not acceptable.\r\n\r\n(And no, introducing another method and deprecating this one as a forwarder is not an option, because testing frameworks must *implement* that method, not call it.)",
