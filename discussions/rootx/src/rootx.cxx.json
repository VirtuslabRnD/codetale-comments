        "body" : "Hi Philippe, This PR (3038) is correct. The one you are referring to (25560) was the first attempt to put in the work done by the summer student Ellie. But it broke the build under some circumstances on some machines and that was not seen by Jenkins. So it was reverted because it was a real nuisance at that time (just after summer). Now I am trying to redo it and see what is going wrong. I would need Guilherme help because he was seeing this build breakage and I was not able to reproduce it. I had also to redo this PR several time because of some conflicts appearing since summer. So to summarise:   PR 3038 (this one) is the replacement of PR 2516 which was reverted because it was creating problems under some circumstances not understood at that time.",
