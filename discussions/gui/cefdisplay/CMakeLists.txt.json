        "body" : "> Is it true also for Windows?\r\n\r\nHave no idea about Windows. \r\nBefore on Linux it was enough just link library and copy some files in binary directory,\r\nbut now with recent CEF one have to copy much more files to `$ROOTSYS/lib` subdirectory - otherwise CEF crashing at very beginning. I will continue investigation - for the moment it is the only way I found\r\n\r\nI for first time manage to compile CEF on my machine from sources and now want to test some new CEF feature with non-X11 backend - maybe one could really use CEF also with headless mode directly.\r\n",
