        "body" : "Here there is again a mix of options. This kind of logic makes it really hard for users to reason about what's enabled or not when they switch something `ON`. For example, `fitpanelv7` will only be enabled if in addition to `root7` one enables also `webgui` option, which contains at least in part ROOT 6 features. I think it's better to discuss with @Axel-Naumann what to do about these options. It would probably be better to consolidate these options into a single thing. Note that `root7` is already entangled with `http` option, which I think is not good. Probably bundling all this into `root7` is better, also to advertise the new features for users that are part of ROOT 7. The other point is that this makes managing the ROOT packages on the various channels harder (e.g. Fedora), since the options are changing in a backward-incompatible way and old build recipes might not work anymore.",

Once it there, one can disentangle `root7` and `http`.\r\n\r\n> Probably bundling all this into root7 is better\r\n\r\nBut then `root7` option will be more or less build `all` option. I would like to have them separately - especially some `webui` parts already working with ROOT6 code - like TWebCanvas and TWebFitPanel, probably TWebBrowser",
