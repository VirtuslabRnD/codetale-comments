However, what you could not have done yourself is run an instance of this pod specification on each node which is what is accomplished with the manifest file at cluster creation time. Notice that CAdvisor also has a manifest pod specification.\n\nWe can connect to a running Fluentd Elasticsearch container to inspect the Fluentd configuration."
