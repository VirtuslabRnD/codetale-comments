A second container, using the `gcr.io/google_containers/fluentd-sidecar-gcp:1.0` image to send the logs to Google Cloud Logging.\n2. A volume for the two containers to share. The emptyDir volume type is a good choice for this because we only want the volume to exist for the lifetime of the pod.\n3. Mount paths for the volume in each container.  In your primary container, this should be the path that the applications log files are written to. In the secondary container, this can be just about anything, so we put it under /mnt/log to keep it out of the way of the rest of the filesystem."
