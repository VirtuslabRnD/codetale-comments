        "body" : "Typing make will just do \"build\" and I have deliberately made it so rather than adding a \"all: build pus\" rule because I think it is safer and more flexible to decouple the process of building from pushing. For example, to help me locally debug and test an image I want to build it, test it out, and when I am happy with it then I will push it. I don't expect anyone other than me is going to run this Makefile which is mainly designed to mitigate the joint effects of RSI and erratic typing on my part.\n",
