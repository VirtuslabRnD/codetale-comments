Inventory scripts allow you to store your hosts, groups, and variables in any way you like. \n\nStarting with Ansible version 2.4, they are enabled via the 'script' inventory plugin.\nExamples of use include discovering inventory from EC2 or pulling it from Cobbler. These could also be used to interface with LDAP or the database.\n"
