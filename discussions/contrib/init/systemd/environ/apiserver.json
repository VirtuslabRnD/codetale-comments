If the \"name\" of the minion that the apiserver sees is `127.0.0.1` then we would use that value to try and point the code int he container at the proxy.  But it couldn't get to the proxy as the `127.0.0.1` _inside_ the container would mask the `127.0.0.1` of the host.  I suspect now that we have IP-per-Service this issue no longer applies.\n",
