This implementation is more correct in the sense that it's putting the correct types into internal data structures now.

However, different controllers rely on the fact that they need to process all objects every X seconds/minutes. So instead of doing relist every such period, we are introducing resync operation, to avoid unnecessary operations on etcd.\n",
