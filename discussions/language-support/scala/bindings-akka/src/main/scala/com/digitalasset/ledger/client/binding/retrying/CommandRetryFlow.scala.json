Unfortunately the client side command tracking mechanism produces such values it self, even though it may not have received it from the ledger. This is used to communicate timeouts (ABORTED) and backpressure (RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED). The reason why I didn't count the ABORTED status code as retryable is that ABORTED is also used for actual rejections in completions.",

I was actually going to ask about `ABORTED` and `UNAVAILABLE`... `ABORTED` case is explained above, how about `UNAVAILABLE`?\r\nHere is the link explaining GRPC error codes: https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/doc/statuscodes.md\r\n\r\n> The service is currently unavailable. This is most likely a transient condition, which can be corrected by retrying with a backoff. Note that it is not always safe to retry non-idempotent operations.\r\n\r\nI think it makes sense to add `UNAVAILABLE` to `RETRYABLE_ERROR_CODES`, all our commands are `idempotent`, right? The unique command id should prevent double submission.\r\n\r\n",
