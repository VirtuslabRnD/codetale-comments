However, if at any point during that process something goes wrong, we `disconnectOldBuildServer()` when that's probably not necessary at all depending on the situation. It may be preferable to instead break those three things out from one another and handle a failure in differently. An argument could be made that if something goes wonky during the build import that _maybe_ could be fixed easily, do we really want to disconnect fully? There may be partial support still very much available. Just something to think about.",

I think in theory, yea, it'd be awesome to just fully get away from the `MetalsServerConfig` altogether, but I'm honest just not sure when. We could do a check on `clientInfo.name` and try to somewhat match on that, but that also may be a bit eh. I'm sort of in the mindset for now to still just leave this in here for a bit since it's not really harming anything.
