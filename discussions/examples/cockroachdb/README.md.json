An example displaying the replication properties would be nice too (i.e set in 1 read from 5), as would a scale up/down example (kubectl edit the petset and modify replicas to 6, does the new replica catch up to the cluster?). Is there a \"master\" we should avoid killing during upgrade? \n\nOptionally, you could write something, bounce the whole cluster (delete pods --all), read the thing. \nAlso mentioning read/write throughput and how that scales with replicas will help. \n",
