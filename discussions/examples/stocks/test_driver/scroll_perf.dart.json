For example, `flutter test` and `pub run test` will attempt to run a driver test, and will fail. Once we gain ability to use `@TestOn` we should be able to put all tests under `test` and run `pub run test -p flutter_driver` and have `flutter test` recognize them out-of-the-box.\n",

The test package just published a release that will let us integrate in a less hacky way.\n\nAnyway, I didn't mean to bikeshed your patch.  We can always move the file around.  :)\n",

We could use a more generic prefix, perhaps `_e2e.dart`. The issue though, is that `pub run test` has no way to specify a custom prefix. I'll start an email thread to discuss. Should be fixable. We just need to pick something.\n",
