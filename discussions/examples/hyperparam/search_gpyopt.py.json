It doesn't look like `projects.run` mutates the current active run (i.e.  it calls `create_run` instead of `start_run`), so we should be able to just call `projects.run` I think without constructing the run beforehand I think? Unless there's something I'm missing",

The alternative would be to use the client api to set the tag manually, but I think this one is cleaner, especially if we would ever decide to inherit more tags.",
