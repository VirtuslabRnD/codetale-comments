Thanks!",

The code, adapted from this [repository](https://github.com/ricardorei/lightning-text-classification/blob/master/classifier.py), is almost entirely dedicated to model training, with the addition of a single ``mlflow.pytorch.autolog()`` call to enable automatic logging of params, metrics, and models.\n "
