The initial model (\"base model\") along with its parameters, metrics and summary are stored in mlflow.\nSubsequently, the base model is pruned iteratively by using the custom \ninputs provided from the cli. Ax is a platform for optimizing any kind of experiment, including machine learning experiments,\nA/B tests, and simulations. [Ax](https://ax.dev/docs/why-ax.html) can optimize discrete configurations using multi-armed bandit optimization,\nand continuous (e.g., integer or floating point)-valued configurations using Bayesian optimization."
