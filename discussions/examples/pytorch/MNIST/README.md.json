It seems we could show logging every N iterations via a single commented-out line of code in ``example1`` (e.g. have a commented-out line like):\r\n\r\n```\r\n# Replace the existing mlflow.pytorch.autolog() call with the one below to log training metrics\r\n# every 10 epochs, instead of the default of logging on every epoch\r\n# mlflow.pytorch.autolog(every_n_epoch=10)\r\nmlflow.pytorch.autolog()\r\n```",
