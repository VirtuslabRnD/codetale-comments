It would be more efficient to make _selectedIndex into an AnimationController and use SlideTransition rather than FractionalTranslation on line 456.  Similarly, _AllSectionsView could become an AnimatedWidget and listen to the animation as well.\r\n\r\n(You'd never actually tell the _selectedIndex animation to go forward(), you'd just set the value and rely on that trigger the widgets listening to the animation.)",
