Let's not do anything in this PR though.\r\n\r\nI can spot one reason for this dependency: we import the `DA.Daml.Compiler.Dar`. I would say it's sort of questionable that this module is part of the compiler library.",

We had a plan to allow fetching DARs automatically if you specify a package id in your daml.yaml and for that it would be convenient if the code was in the compiler and you didn’t have to shell out to `daml-helper`. But we never implemented this so it didn’t go anywhere.",
