I’m not too worried about having them copied here provided we have instructions for how to generate them (e.g. the bash script in this PR) but we could factor it out into a `genrule` and avoid that. The main issue is (as usual) Windows, where we cannot simply get openssl from nix but need to figure out some other source. Haven’t looked into it, it might be very simple. But the ssl certs are valid for 10 years so I don’t think this is particularly urgent :slightly_smiling_face: ",
