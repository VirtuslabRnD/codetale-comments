        "body" : "In general, I think the *right* thing for us (and the whole ecosystem) to do would be to publish for the latest stable Dotty (in this case, 0.24.0) *as well as* the exact latest RC (in this case, 0.25.0-RC2). Obviously it's a pain keeping up with RCs, but it helps quite a bit. Dependencies which don't do this, particularly those which lack macro usage, effectively force their downstream dependents to fall back on the 2.13 cross-publish, which is annoying.\r\n\r\nObviously though, in our case, we can't really do anything that ScalaTest doesn't do, so our hands are tied.",
