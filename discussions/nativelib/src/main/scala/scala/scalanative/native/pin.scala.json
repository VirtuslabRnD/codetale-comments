We need this here not to eliminate fields of `java.lang.String` if its instances were constructed without calling a constructor (e.g. literal strings.) But it should be also useful as a sane contract between reflection and link-time dead-code elimination: annotate all inner members with `@pin` and pin all classes that should be reachable in the build (to be added in later PRs.)\n",
