        "body" : "A proposal for the commit message:\r\n\r\n```\r\nThe ROOT command line tools (e.g. rootls, rootmkdir, ...) are configured with\r\na header that tells the script which python to use. In the old approach, what\r\nwas written in that header was just the name of the Python binary file in\r\n${PYTHON_EXECUTABLE}, while the path was stripped out. This led to an\r\nissue with the brew installation on MacOs, since ROOT was built with a\r\npython3 installation (3.8 to be more exact) and therefore \"python3\" was\r\ninjected in the header of the command line tools. However, the system\r\nhad another python3 installation (3.7), which was the one executed\r\nwhen just running \"python3\". This caused that the command line tools\r\nran with a different python installation than the one ROOT was built\r\nwith, and this led to a crash (ROOT-10720).\r\n\r\nThis commit solves the issue by injecting the full path to the\r\n(highest) python ROOT was built with in the header of the\r\ncommand line tools.\r\n```\r\n",
