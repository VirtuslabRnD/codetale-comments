Note that **cats-effect** has an upstream dependency on **cats-core** version 1.x.\n\nCross-builds are available for Scala 2.11.x, 2.12.x, and 2.13.0-RC2, as well as Scala.js 0.6.x. Version 2.0.0-M2 has been cross-built for 2.13.0-RC2 and depends upon cats-core version 2.x.\n\nThe most current snapshot (or major release) can be found in the maven badge at the top of this readme.  If you are a very brave sort, you are free to depend on snapshots; they are stable versions, as they are derived from the git hash rather than an unstable `-SNAPSHOT` suffix, but they do not come with any particular confidence or compatibility guarantees."

Eg. provides different `ExecutionContext`s based on the type of work the user needs to perform. In addition, I think it works for the `0.10.x` series? In that case, I think it's worth keeping it in the list but I'll leave the final word to @ChristopherDavenport .",
