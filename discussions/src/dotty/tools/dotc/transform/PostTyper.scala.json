Alternatively, try to run scalac's existing SuperAccessors before PatternMacther. I am not sure the \ncomment that says you can't is still accurate. (2), (3) and (4) are done in  scalac's typer already, so no need to redo.\nI am not sure where (5)-(8) are done; you'd have to check that and possibly duplicate. But they are small things.\n",
