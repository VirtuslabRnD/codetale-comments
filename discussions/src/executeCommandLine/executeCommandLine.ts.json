I initially thought that maybe it can be more verbose but healthier to do something like\r\n\r\n    startTracing();\r\n    tracing?.dumpLegend();\r\n    stopTracing();\r\n\r\nbut on top of that there's the arguments that are needed for starting, so it's probably not worth it.  But I still dislike that this goes out of the nice only-start-stop-are-exposed thing...\r\n",
