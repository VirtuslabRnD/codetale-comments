        "body" : "What exactly is the motivation for moving them to fourslash? Having them here, with the code in template strings, has the advantage that you can read line and offset from your editor. In fourslash, offset would be difficult to use because of the four slashes and marker characters. As an alternative, I wrote a utility to convert these existing tests to fourslash ranges, thinking that might be easier to write and read, but I think it's worse, at least to read:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[|type M = [|{ [|[|-readonly [K in keyof any][|-[|/**/?|]|]|]: any|] }|];|]|]\r\n```\r\n\r\nI get that fourslash is one step closer to the language service, but I'm not sure it's a good format for assertions about this. Have any suggestions?",
