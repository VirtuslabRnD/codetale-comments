The extraction range should *always* have shrunk to only the initializer because that is the range that is actually extracted. This should have been a valid test before, but it didn't exist:\r\n\r\n`[#|var x = [$|1|];|]`\r\n\r\nIn this case, the entire variable statement is selected which simply gets checked for an initializer.\r\n\r\nThe test changed here was meant to show that the refactor does not work if the semicolon is not selected (because the entire statement had to be within the span). My semicolon change simply ignores this weird case and pretends you selected the semicolon.",
