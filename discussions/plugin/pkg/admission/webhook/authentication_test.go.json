(I don't object to the implementation, it just seems like it will help < 1% of people while making 100% of people have to understand it.)\r\n\r\nAuthentication domains often follow real domains.  If you don't allow any wildcarding, then adding a new service in an existing namespace could require rolling a large number of configmaps.   If you do allow wildcarding, then people can choose to use the feature and avoid unnecessary config changes if they understand their deployment topology.\r\n\r\nSupporting wildcards does not force anyone to use them, so until someone asks the question, \"I have multiple webhooks for my domain, how can I avoid fanning out in this file\", they won't care, they'll be able to use exact matches.\r\n\r\n",
