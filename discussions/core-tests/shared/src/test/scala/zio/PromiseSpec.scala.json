        "body" : "@jdegoes @ghostdogpr What if we made `TimeoutStrategy` a subtype of `TestAspect`? `TestAspect.timeout` is already isomorphic with `TestStrategy.Error`. `TestStrategy.Ignore` is a no-op, so that would be equivalent to `TestAspect.identity`, which we don't have but could easily add. So the only thing would be whether we could implement `Warn` as a `TestAspect`. I remember when I worked on the original PR I thought we couldn't for some reason but I think maybe I reworked it after that because the type signatures look the same. \r\n\r\nThat would go a long way to unify things because then everything would be a `TestAspect` so at worst there are two different ways to add a `TestAspect` versus having this `TestAspect.timeout` and then `TimeoutStrategy` that are completely different things. I'm a little concerned with moving it to `Runner` because I think that makes it more difficult for us to have a default timeout policy that is also easily override by a user who is just extending `DefaultRunnableSpec` But maybe if we do that unification it addresses your concerns?",
