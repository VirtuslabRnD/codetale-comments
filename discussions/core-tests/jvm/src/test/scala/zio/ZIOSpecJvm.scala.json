        "body" : "We should move this to the `shared` folder so these tests run on both the JVM and ScalaJS. It doesn't look like any of them involve blocking effects that wouldn't be available cross-platform. I think it was just labeled this way for historical reasons because not all of the tests had been migrated previously. Ideally we would make these tests part of the existing `ZIOSpec.scala` file though we may need to split it if the file length gets too long.",
