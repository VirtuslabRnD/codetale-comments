Code (from below):\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nrelations match {\r\n      case p :: bin :: lcn :: mri :: mre :: ii :: ie :: lii :: lie :: cn :: un :: bcn :: Nil =>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIs IMO one of the most hacky thing in whole zinc codebase and at some point it needs to be cleanup and refactored.\r\nI tried to do so in this PR but after some time I look at diff and I was way to big for single PR (and I needed to fit cached compilation related changes).
