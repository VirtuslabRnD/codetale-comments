I wouldn't have noticed the regression were it not for https://github.com/eatkins/scala-build-watch-performance. That being said, a useful heuristic that I try to follow is to avoid copying data if at all possible. It's often hard to tell in isolation whether or not copying will impact performance. I also try to practice the boy scout rule of leaving things better than I found them.",
