        "body" : "I think that this is a very important point. If it is possible to shrink or completely eliminate the `*Mappers` API by implementing `getMachineIndependentMapper` in a way that works for all consumers, this will be much less fragile. As it stands, zinc is punting to consumers to have them figure out which portions of the analysis internals are not portable... when zinc itself is best positioned to do that.\r\n\r\nAs previously discussed, I'd be OK with leaving the `*Mappers` API public and marked experimental, but it would be great to have an explicit goal of making getMachineIndependentMapper a default that will work for 95% of consumers.",
