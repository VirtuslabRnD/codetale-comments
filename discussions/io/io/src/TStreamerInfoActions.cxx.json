For example those at line 583 or 605 should (eventually) lead to 2 more version of this functions (possibly build by composition to avoid code duplication) where each version contains only the code path needed and no (well less) conditional statements.",

And all JSON/XML/SQL buffers derive from it. Problem - XML and SQL buffers are inherited from TBufferFile, which could be difficult to brake. \r\n\r\nBut if it would work, TBufferFile interfaces can be used exclusively for binary operations and TBufferText exclusively for text-based. Of course, all virtual methods for TBuffer will be implemented for both classes. I will check if it can be done this way.",
