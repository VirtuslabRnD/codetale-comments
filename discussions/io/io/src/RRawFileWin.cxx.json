        "body" : "I can certainly make that change. My reasoning was that usually I/O errors are not very strictly handled by upper layers, so if the exception is not handled the program does the right thing and crashes instead of continuing with dodgy data. For instance, I think that `RCsvDS` currently does not strictly distinguish between end-of-file and I/O errors. @dpiparo @bluehood What do you think?",
