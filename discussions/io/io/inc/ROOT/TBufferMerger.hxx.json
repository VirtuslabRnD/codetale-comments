Here you can not predict the maximum number of TStreamerInfo involved in storing data in this file.\r\n\r\nThe reason it is a TArrayC is that at the time the original version of this code was written (circa 2000), TBits did not exist yet ... i.e. this code is copy/paste per se from TFile::WriteStreamerInfo.\r\n\r\nThe purpose is solely to keep track of whether a StreamerInfo, refer to by its index has been sent over ...\r\n\r\n... right but that does not make any sense when the client and the  server are in the same process ....\r\n\r\nSo actually WriteStreamerInfo and any use of fClassSent can go away ....\r\n",
