When the requested version is 0, it really means the current version (which supposedly isn't itself equal to 0), so this let's the detection work properly and return the version already available (that's the point of this check).

As commented above, we may need to go back to taking the lock despite the performance penalty. On the other hand, we need a better long term solution for our thread-safety issues. On one side we need a test suite to catch thread-safety problems like these, and on the other, we need a better way than taking locks and using atomics.\r\n> ",
