At least we could sort by default or add a `--sorted` option if that makes sense. But we can always grep and sort by group id using standard Linux shell utils. From the user perspective though, data given in a sorted order is a bit more expected and desired than randomly ordered. Do you think the same? (I mean to enable sorting by default)",
