        "body" : "Yes, the issue this PR fixes is a timing issue that the new unit tests catch, but it is unlikely that we hit it in integration tests. I added this integration test anyway to make sure the fix hasn't broken anything. I was in two minds about whether to check it in, but included anyway since I thought it may help catch regressions with max.in.flight=1 in future. Also, Jenkins builds on slower machines may occasionally hit timing windows we don't usually see otherwise. Don't mind removing if we think it is not worth the maintenance cost.",
