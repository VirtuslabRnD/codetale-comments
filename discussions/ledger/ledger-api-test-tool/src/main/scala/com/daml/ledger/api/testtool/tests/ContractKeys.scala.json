        "body" : "Consider the following situation:\r\n`Alice` can send a command that results in a transaction with a `NodeLookupByKey` with the right authorization, but `Alice` is not actually a stakeholder of the contract that the lookup would resolve to, therefore the `NodeLookupByKey` doesn't find a contract. Based on that fact, the DAML model can make a decision (i.e. create a contract with such a key). However, during validation the committer sees that there already exists such a contract. In that case the validation needs to fail, because the original transaction didn't have an accurate view of the ledger.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, if there is contention on the contract key, the validation shows that the original `NodeLookupByKey` and all following actions are invalid.",
