        "body" : "It would throw. The problem is it's quite difficult to reliably detect if the time service is there. In the case of the DAML-on-X reference implementation, for example, the `TimeService` exists also on wall-clock time but it's not capable of doing time travel (which makes sense). So using `skipIf` would not work very reliably unless we signal the compliance with the `TimeService` via configuration/CLI, which could be effectively equivalent to simply specifying to include or exclude the `TimeIT` test. Would that be a feasible approach to the problem?",
