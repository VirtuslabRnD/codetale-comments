        "body" : "I have been using a `com.codahale.metrics.Meter`. Internally, it has a variable `count` that is incremented on every call to `Meter.mark()`. The `GraphiteReporter` reports the value of `count` to Graphite.\r\n\r\nIn my test, I was reporting 6 values per minute of the metric `my-metric.count` to Graphite. Graphite was only storing one value per minute. Due to the rule I have now deleted, it was summing up the 6 values instead of taking the average.\r\n\r\nLooking at the source code of `com.codahale.metrics.Counter` it seems to be the same story for counters.",
