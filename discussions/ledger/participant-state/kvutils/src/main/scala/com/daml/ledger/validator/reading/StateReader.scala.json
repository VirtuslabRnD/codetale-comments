        "body" : "I changed this to allow the keys to be a `Set` or a key set, and kept it because we now pass an iterable to this function.\r\n\r\nWe now store the read set as a `Map[DamlStateKey, Fingerprint]`, rather than a `Seq[(Key, Fingerprint)]`. To perform conflict detection, we need to get the keys and values separately, and `Map#unzip` returns `(Iterable[K], Iterable[V])`, so to avoid converting to a `Seq`, we need to be able to accept an iterable.\r\n\r\nThis now aligns with `LedgerStateOperations#readState`, which accepts an `Iterable[Key]` and returns a `Seq[Option[Value]]`.",
