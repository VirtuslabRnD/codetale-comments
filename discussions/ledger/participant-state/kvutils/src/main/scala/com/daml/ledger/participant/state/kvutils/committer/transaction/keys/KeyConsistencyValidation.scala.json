        "body" : "@miklos-da this was just broken beforehand already. The `+` operator takes the second activeStateKeys set which means that here you always set it to an empty set. I added a testcase for this that fails on main (the two local key conflicts).\r\n\r\nRather than trying to fix this, I’ve just scraped the whole use of `+`. imho the new code is simpler and easier to get right but if you feel strongly about this, I can go back to the other solution. A fix would probably be for `+` to take the union instead. That doesn’t really make sense since a later state should always have a superset but given the way the code is setup here, that’s not the case.",
