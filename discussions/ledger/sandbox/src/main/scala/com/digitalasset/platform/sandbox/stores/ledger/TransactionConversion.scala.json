This lead to two (already existing) conformance tests failing, which were actually fixed by me no longing intersecting the parties with the witnesses. I don't know why that would be. I'll try to run some further tests and see if restoring the `stakeholder`s to their previous state works. Still, it would be unclear to me why those tests would fail, as I would expect the union of signatories intersected with witnesses and observers intersected with witnesses to be the same as stakeholders intersected with witnesses, unless I'm missing something in how stakeholders are exposed as transaction nodes.",

Before when populating signatories and observers I intersected them with witnesses, which I would have assumed would have made the union valid and non-breaking as compared to the previous implementation.

I'm running another test filtering stakeholders up to the witnesses as before, but I don't see why my previous approach wasn't working.",

The witnesses already serve the purpose of \"why am I seeing this?\". The signatories are a property of the contract, and thus should be left intact.",
