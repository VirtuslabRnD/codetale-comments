        "body" : "Together with the actual tests above, this covers the common uses of multi-party submissions, but only at the command level. `actAs` only has an effect at the command level as it sets the available authorizers for top-level actions, but `read` as has an effect on any action in the transaction tree.\r\n\r\nFor completeness, I would therefore add a few tests that test reads at least one level down in the transaction tree. For example:\r\n\r\n1. Give the template a contract key `key this: MultiPartyContract; maintainer key.parties`.\r\n2. Give the template three choices `FetchOther, FetchOtherByKey, LookupOther`, which take a cid, or key or a second contract instance, respectively.\r\n3. Test all 12 combinations of\r\n  - 3 choices\r\n  - Well-authorized or not\r\n  - Contract to be looked up visible or not\r\n ",

Bob creates a `MultiPartyContract` for himself (let's call it `cB`)\r\n3. Bob exercise a `FetchOther` choice on his contract `cB`, which attempts to fetch contract `cA`. This is well-authorized, but the contract lookup will fail unless Alice is a `readAs` party or `cA` has been divulged to Bob.",
