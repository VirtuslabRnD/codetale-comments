        "body" : "Not only this, but also the CompressionStrategy is quite different. As part of the PoC I had to rebase at some point, and I faced all changes regarding compression. There I wanted to have compression easily used in the new PoC indexer, and therefore I made refactorings to the original compression supporting code. I think the refactoring makes sense, and I would go ahead with that if that's fine with you.\r\nSomething else to note: the store.serialisation.Compression code was not changing much during my Compression refactorings, so I kept that around (was not forking that as well).\r\nOn that account: I forgot to add there a TODO to cleanup that helper method which is not needed any more...just did that as well.",
