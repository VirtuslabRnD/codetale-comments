        "body" : "The divulgence addition I removed was driven by `Fetch` nodes in the transaction: the contract ID was taken from the `Fetch` node but used to look up the divulged parties in the blinding info.\r\n\r\nPerhaps there was little point in letting `Fetch` nodes drive the divulgence additions even before this PR but it was still working; here it's not working anymore though, because `Fetch` nodes have been removed.\r\n\r\nIf blinding info computation is correct, then this behavior should be equivalent to the previous one. I don't know the extent of that coverage but I see there is some [here](https://github.com/digital-asset/daml/blob/master/daml-lf/engine/src/test/scala/com/digitalasset/daml/lf/engine/EngineTest.scala).\r\n\r\nIt looks to me like we have divulgence coverage as Ledger API test tool tests as well (e.g. [here](https://github.com/digital-asset/daml/blob/master/ledger/ledger-api-test-tool/src/main/scala/com/daml/ledger/api/testtool/tests/WitnessesIT.scala#L12)) and BTW divulgence-related tests were failing in this PR before the `TransactionIndexing` change (and the test I added was failing as well).\r\n\r\nWhich cases you think are not already covered?",
