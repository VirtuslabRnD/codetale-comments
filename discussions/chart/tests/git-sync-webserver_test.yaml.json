        "body" : "They have no impact. But I chose the approach that I did not want to add all the different combinations here. There is apparently missing set of unit tests for all the different combinations of parameters for the helm charts - for example only the git-sync option is tested for the helm chart rather than all combinations. So rather than fixing the underlying problem (which might take a lot of time) I wanted to add a simple test in the only webserver test I have found - with git sync and persiatence. \n\nI think if we want to add more tests we would need to add more comprehensive set of tests but for now this is the simplest test I can add.\n\n\nI guess more comprehensive tests should be the prerequisite for helm chart testing. WDYT @dimbermann ? Is it worth to add more comprehensive tests or should it be deferred ? ",
