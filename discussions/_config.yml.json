Ive also got both v1.0 and v1.1 working in my local build (testing the v1.1 setup by using a copy of the v1.0 .html files).\n\nI think you have the option to list individual collection names (and use dashes) but if you add meta data (ie how ive forced/ensure our collections get built and use \"output: true\"), then you have to remove dashes.\n\nThe old dashes were left in there from my early testing/trying to get this working for v1.0. Dashes were used initially because a few sources I used online, including the [Jekyll help docs](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/collections/#step-1-tell-jekyll-to-read-in-your-collection) are a little confusing and have examples both with and without dashes.\n",
