Also in our case we use the different (recommended) pattern for dockerignore: exclude all + include only what's needed. This is much better for docker context stability. And simply having a separate simple docker like that one is a super easy way to see which files are added to context (then we can change the +g/-g flags for only those files - for docker cache invalidation purpose).
