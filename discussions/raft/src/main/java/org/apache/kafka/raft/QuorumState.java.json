        "body" : "Makes me thinking: if we have an even number sized quorum (say 2N), and the leader is resigning. Then before the leader shutdown we need N+1 votes, while after the leader shutdown, the quorum size shrink to 2N-1 and we would only need N votes. So if the resigning leader gives it a vote to a candidate and then shutdown, while the candidates thinks they only need N votes, would that potentially result in two candidates claiming victory --- somehow this sounds quite close to the real world :P --- each with N votes while one of them has the vote from the resigned leader?",
