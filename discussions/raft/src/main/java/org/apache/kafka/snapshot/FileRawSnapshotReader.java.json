        "body" : "Yeah. For consistency in the API. For example, most of the methods in this type perform an IO operation which can throw an `IOException` yet they have already been implemented to wrap them in a uncheck exception. In some places we wrap this on a unchecked exception is some places we don't. For the raft module, we have made an implicit decision to prefer uncheck exceptions for IO errors.\r\n\r\nI tried to clean this up in https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/10085:\r\n> 5. Removed throws IOException from some methods. Some of types were inconsistently throwing IOException in some cases and throwing RuntimeException(..., new IOException(...)) in others. This PR improves the consistent by wrapping IOException in RuntimeException in a few more places and replacing Closeable with AutoCloseable.\r\n\r\nThis PR expands on that work/decision.",
