        "body" : "I use them for three things in this PR:\r\n\r\n1. matching constraint signatures nicely,\r\n2. letting the functor layer go up and down when I haven't settled on which layer will operate where. e.g. TriggerSetup very nearly got elided for the final design, but it was needed for the low-level initialState as you wanted, so it survived causing very little trouble at the DAML layer (at the Scala layer is another story), and\r\n3. _not_ letting operations pollute upwards. For example it would be very undesirable for `ActionState TriggerAState TriggerA` to exist; it might even be desirable to remove `ActionTrigger TriggerA` so as to hide `submitCommands` from the high-level API.\r\n\r\n(2) is naturally just scaffolding, but we should take care about (3). And of course damlc will just yell at you for not thinking about (1).",
