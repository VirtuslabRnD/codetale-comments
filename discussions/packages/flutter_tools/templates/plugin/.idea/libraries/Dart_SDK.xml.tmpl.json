        "body" : "Here's a start:\r\n\r\nThis is how the Dart plugin writes out the location of the Dart SDK in an IDEA project. It was changed recently - this used to be a global setting and it's now a per-project setting. It lists all core libraries because the same SDK can be used to run both Dart and Flutter code. I don't know how often the Dart plugin updates the list from the Dart SDK itself.\r\n\r\nWe don't expect users to edit this file. That's why it's in the .idea directory.\r\n\r\nIt's also used by the Flutter plugin; we derive the location of the Flutter SDK from the Dart SDK.\r\n\r\nWe've been discussing other ways to determine the location of the Flutter SDK. See discussion in #10096.",

        "body" : "It can't be in the flutter repo because it's how the IDE locates the flutter repo. (Also, everything in the .idea directory is part of IntelliJ's world so we can't just change the file location or format.)\r\n\r\nAn alternate approach would be to record the path to the Flutter SDK somewhere else, and the Flutter plugin can set the location of the Dart SDK on project open, which will cause the Dart plugin to generate this file. That way it doesn't have to be in the template.\r\n\r\nSo far the best idea seems to be to derive it from the .packages file. That would work fine for `flutter create` but maybe not so great after doing a `git clone` on a Flutter app's repo, since `flutter packages get` hasn't been run yet. Then again, the location of the flutter repo is machine-specific, so making the user choose it might not be so bad?\r\n\r\n(I think @pq has some plans to work on the getting started experience.)\r\n",
