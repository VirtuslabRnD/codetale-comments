Are these just validators that don't belong to any workflow?",

        "body" : "I'm more or less breaking the old, implicit relationship where a workflow is-a validator (both workflow classes were also validators and DoctorValidatorProvider also made that assumption), so they're now two totally separate classes. A validator is still a validator (checks for installed software and generates doctor output), while a workflow checks if the environment is one where we can list or launch devices. \r\n\r\nThe only relation between validators and workflows now is that we use Workflow.appliesToHostPlatform to decide whether to add a validator to the validator list (skipping the iOS validator if we're not on Mac).\r\n\r\nThe validators in the provider are effectively the same as they used to be. The new workflows list is there because I can no longer have the validators list do double duty, so I'm explicitly listing them instead of using the old code that got them implicitly by checking which validators were also workflows.\r\n\r\nWorkflow might be a bad name for it now, since the class scope is a lot smaller now that the validator methods have been pulled out. But I don't know what would be a good, unconfusing name.",
