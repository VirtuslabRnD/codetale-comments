The checks are slightly different for each case.\r\n\r\nAlso, it's not just whitespace -- As long as the characters are not alphabets and underscores (a-z, A-Z, and _), then it should be okay to not use curly braces, since the Dart code would treat everything else as part of the string and not part of the variable name.",
