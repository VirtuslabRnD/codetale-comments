        "body" : "Ideally, we'd avoid having both `flutter pub run` and `flutter pub pub run`, but I don't see an easy way to do that. A simple idea which I think may not work is to remove `flutter pub pub`, and delegate to the `PackagesPassthroughCommand` whenever the `PackagesCommand` doesn't recognize the subcommand. This doesn't work because there would be ambiguity between, e.g. the `get` subcommand of `PackagesCommand` and `pub get` (there are others as well).",

But I think it too soon; we need the `flutter pub` commands out in stable for a few releases before I would feel safe doing that.",
