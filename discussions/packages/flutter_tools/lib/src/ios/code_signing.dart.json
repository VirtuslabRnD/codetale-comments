I'd really prefer a [linter rule for EOL whitespace](https://github.com/dart-lang/linter/issues/1088), but it doesn't exist yet.\r\n\r\nI'm happy to just fix the test and remove the whitespace if you think that won't be a problem.  If I did that, I'd just remove the last part of the string in the test.",
