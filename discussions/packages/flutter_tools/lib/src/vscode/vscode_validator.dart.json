I guess the criteria for whether we display the vscode location is whether we think it'd be useful for users debugging issues, or use debugging users reported issues.",

        "body" : "I think there's less value for VS Code because we only look in default install locations; we don't really scan around (or support overriding the path). However I do think it may come in handy for debugging (esp on Windows where there are more options - there's 64bit + 32bit and also the paths aren't fixed since they come from progfiles env vars) and since doctor output is quite terse by default now, I don't think it's adding noise.\r\n\r\n(ofc, I don't feel strongly either way, so happy to remove if requested)",
