Here is a breakdown of how things work today, what this CL does, and what we might want to do in the future:\r\n\r\nToday:\r\nFlutter looks at the platform and build tools versions and selects a version of build tools that has the same major version of the platform. The result of this is that flutter guarantees platformVersion.major == buildToolsVersion.major.\r\n\r\nFlutter does not look at platform tools or SDK tools today. Maybe it should, I don't know.\r\n\r\nThis CL:\r\nDetects if the platform/build tool major versions (they are always the same for Flutter right now) are >= 25.\r\n\r\nFuture:\r\nIn the future we may want to validate version numbers of each of these artifacts individually and may eventually need to build a blacklist / whitelist around version combinations.",

Instead, Gradle uses the versions specified in the build.gradle file, so it doesn't really matter what version flutter thinks it has 'selected'.\r\n\r\nGradle will also automatically download the versions of build tools and SDK it needs, so there's no point in checking that they're installed before we call Gradle.\r\n\r\nWe currently still support the legacy builds, where this check (and the SDK/build tools selection) matters, but once we remove that and switch completely to Gradle (#8455), all we need to check is that the SDK/build tools licenses have been accepted (#8093).",
