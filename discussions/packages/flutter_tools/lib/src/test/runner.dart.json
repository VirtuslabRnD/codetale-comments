        "body" : "Before, it would default to N/2 for regular tests, and 2 for coverage, where N is the number of CPUs. But that was based on what we needed for Travis. Now it defaults to N-2 for everything.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure what the defaults should actually be. N/2 is definitely too low for regular tests when you have a lot of CPUs (on my 20 CPU machine, about half the machine, around 8 CPUs, is entirely idle when I'm running tests). I don't know what Cirrus can take. So I figured that scaling the numbers back up and seeing what would happen was probably the next move. :-)",
