Some users don't even use it but instead launch their apps and scripts by hand. It seems this will make it less obvious how to run things yourself. Am I missing something?",

        "body" : "Fair question, this is really more of a cleanup for the flutter repo. It doesn't effect users at all. \r\n\r\nA user can write a test which uses `package:test` and then run the test with dart or pub the same as normal. This is because the `package:test` entry point is ultimately the same as the `package:test_core` entry point.\r\n\r\nHowever, this slight refactoring allows `flutter/flutter` to stop using package test and instead export `test_api` from our testing shims.\r\n\r\nIn the future we might could consider exporting `test_api` from `flutter_driver` to completely remove the need for package test. This would actually remove the ability to run the test script directly with dart. However, that is not what the change is about.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
