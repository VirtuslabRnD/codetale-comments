I couldn't quite figure out how to get `matchesGoldenFile` to work with Skia gold though (following https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Writing-a-golden-file-test-for-package%3Aflutter). cc @Piinks - is the Skia golden integration supported for non-`package:flutter` packages like this? If not I can just check in the png into the `tests/` directory alongside this test, but not sure if that's the best practice for this repo.",
