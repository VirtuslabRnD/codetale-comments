I'm guessing the linter is much simpler if it has to enforce the same rule in all code.\n",

It felt like I was adding `<String, dynamic>` annotations to a lot of things, and in many cases it was very unclear what exactly I should be adding; I'm sure I got some wrong. (Bug https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/issues/25989 didn't help.) Maybe I misunderstood what the code was doing. I would have felt better if all the code that involved \"dynamic\" had been synchronous and in one place, generating strongly-typed data structures. I don't think we should ever have a Future or Map that passes a `Map<String, dynamic>`, it's too bug-prone (it basically entirely side-steps the static checker).\n",
