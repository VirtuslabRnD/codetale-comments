At least with -1, that would be an invalid value given that the field is meant to be time since beginning of tracing).\r\n\r\nOr doing a null == 0 test on the saved values and then just falling into the compareTo method?\r\n\r\nOr having a fake getter for nonNullTimestampMicros (or \"sortingMetric\")?",
