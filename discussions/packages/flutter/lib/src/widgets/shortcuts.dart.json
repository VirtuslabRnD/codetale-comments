Compare this:\r\n```dart\r\nLogicalKeySet(LogicalKeyboardKey.tab): const Intent(NextFocusAction.key),\r\nLogicalKeySet(LogicalKeyboardKey.shift, LogicalKeyboardKey.tab): const Intent(PreviousFocusAction.key),\r\n```\r\nwith this:\r\n```dart\r\nLogicalKeySet(<LogicalKeyboardKey>{LogicalKeyboardKey.tab}): const Intent(NextFocusAction.key),\r\nLogicalKeySet(<LogicalKeyboardKey>{LogicalKeyboardKey.shift, LogicalKeyboardKey.tab}): const Intent(PreviousFocusAction.key}),\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd it's not because of the duplicate checking, because Dart sets aren't multisets, so there are no duplicates in a `Set` anyhow.\r\n\r\nThe vast majority of key bindings will be single keys (or maybe two), so I thought it made sense to streamline those a bit.",
