        "body" : "We should delete it from the animations package and use the one from the framework here. Deleting itself should be fine since the builder was never part of the public interface of the animations package. However while the DualTransitionBuilder exists in two places, I suspect there may be a conflict within the animations package as there are now two competing DualTransitionBuilder definitions. If that is the case, we should hide the framework implementation in the package until this change has made it to stable and then delete the implementation in the package (while increasing the minimal flutter version). \r\n\r\nCan you please check whether the example app in the animation package builds correctly with this change applied to your Flutter version? If it doesn't we will have to hide this implementation in the package before this change can land.",
