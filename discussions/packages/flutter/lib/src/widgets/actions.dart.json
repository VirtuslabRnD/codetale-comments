        "body" : "Yes, I'm anticipating having subclasses. Take a look at `dev/manual_tests/lib/actions.dart` and you'll see an example of this.  Having the ability to subclass and replace your own `ActionDispatcher` means you can have complete control over the dispatch.  I could have this be just a single \"invoke\" function that you supply, but it feels more like a class because there could be other operations we want to add in the future (mayby `canInvoke`, or something), and this gives us a place to put it.",
