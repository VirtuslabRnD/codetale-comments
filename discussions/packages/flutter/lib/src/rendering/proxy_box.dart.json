Isn't \"hit\" the same as \"put it in the event path\"?\n\nHow about \"Consider this target hit whenever the position being hit tested is within its bounds, and continue hit testing further elements behind this one.\"\n\nAnd maybe the other two should be rephrased to split the \"getting hit\" concept from the \"prevent going through\" concept? I'm not sure exactly how to phrase this.\n\nMaybe just remove the \"Never consider...\" sentence and just let the other sentence for translucent describe it...\n",
