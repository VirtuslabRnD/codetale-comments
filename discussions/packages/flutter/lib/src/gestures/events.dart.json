One of the asserts fired after I added it, which made me realize that `pointer` shouldn't actually be a field on a scroll event, since a pointer in the Flutter event system corresponds to a touch, essentially, and scrolls don't have to (and usually don't) come from a pointer that's down, nor does the scroll system need to know what pointer if any it's associated with. Yay for assertions :)\r\n\r\nRelated: all of the pointer event classes say that everything must be non-null, but none of them assert; would you like me to file a bug to track the missing asserts? (I'm not sure if that would be considered breaking, and thus potentially not worth doing.)",
