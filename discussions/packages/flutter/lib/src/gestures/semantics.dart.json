If so, then I worry a bit that if we modify GestureTapCallback, then we'd have to know to also change this signature.\r\n\r\nProbably not a big deal, since the compiler will complain a lot if that happens, but you might want to put some non-doc comments here about keeping them in sync.\r\n\r\nIf this is just renaming the type of arguments here (as it looks like it might be), then this is fine.",

Actually I was about to change this callback to include a `SemanticsTapDetails`, but didn't because that will be a breaking change for `RenderSemanticsGestureHandler`. I think when it happens (which will be a breaking change anyway) we should _not_ keep them in sync.",
