Not enough to want to rename it, really, but just a little worry. Would `HardwareKeyboardManager` be clearer? Or is it just longer and not providing any value?",

I understand that this might confuse with on-screen keyboards, but I think this is something that can be explained.\r\n\r\nAlso we might use `HardwareKeyboardState`, since this class only has state getters besides adding and removing listeners.",
