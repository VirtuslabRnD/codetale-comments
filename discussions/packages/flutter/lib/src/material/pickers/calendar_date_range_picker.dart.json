I know what you mean though: it would be nice if things could be made private to anything in the pub package.\r\n\r\nLike it or not, it's part of the public API, it just isn't exported with the top level include points.  Anyone can use this class with:\r\n```dart\r\nimport 'package:/flutter/src/material/pickers/calendar_date_range_picker.dart';\r\n```\r\n\r\nSure, it's not likely, but they could.\r\n\r\nAnyhow, it's not a big deal: I suspect that a) people are on their own if they do that, and 2) that we might want to make this a public API anyhow.\r\n\r\nIf you're not ready to make it public, though, it's probably OK to put it in the other huge file and make it private. We have plenty of those in Flutter (mostly for that reason) already. `widgets/basic.dart` is 7,144 lines...",
