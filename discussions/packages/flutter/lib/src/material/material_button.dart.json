For example, getTextTheme is called 5 or 6 times in various parts of the buttonTheme helper methods. \r\n\r\n- are the tags useful or a bit of a hack?\r\n\r\nConsider an alternative design, where instead of having tags we have `n` different functions which take a `MaterialButton` and return some `RawMaterialButton` or other widget. This might be worse in someways, but I think it connects the tag directly to the produced theme value. It also still allows us to avoid computing theme values we don't need while avoiding repetitive calculations.\r\n\r\nMight not matter",
