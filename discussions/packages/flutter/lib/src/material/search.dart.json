Inside `text_field.dart` in `_getEffectiveDecoration` it should apply the theme values to the decoration and so the hintStyle should be passed along that way.\r\n\r\nCould you please take a look as to why this isn't happening and see if there is fix that can be applied more broadly to TextFields? Thanks!",

So this isn't a Text Field issue, rather one an issue with the search delegate?",

        "body" : "I agree with @NBTX.  `appBarTheme` provided in the SearchDelegate is not set as the theme for the context.  Instead, a few of its properties are \"cherry picked\" and set on the AppBar and the TextField.  When TextField grabs values from the theme, it is looking at the overall app theme and not SearchDelegate's `appBarTheme`.\r\n\r\nIf you set `hintColor` in the app theme then it will be respected by the Search TextField.  If you set it in appBarTheme it will be ignored (without this PR).\r\n\r\nOverall it seems like this pattern is confusing and there is probably a better way to handle this sort of theming, but for now, I think this PR looks like a good improvement. @rami-a What do you think about moving forward with merging this?\r\n",
