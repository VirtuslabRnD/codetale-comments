        "body" : "Grey seemed like a special case, because it's sort of a \"colorless color\" and Colors.grey array contains more levels than the other primaries. The particular use case I was solving for was picking a random Material color, and I didn't want something to look disabled, and Colors.primaries.where((c) c != Colors.grey) seemed a bit verbose. But that said, I can see a valid argument for leaving grey in -- it's fine by me either way.\n",
