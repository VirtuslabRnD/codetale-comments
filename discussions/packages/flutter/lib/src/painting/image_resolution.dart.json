Like upscaling from 1.0 to 1.25 is a 25% increase, but 2.0 to 2.25 is only a 12.5% increase.\r\n\r\nI'm just throwing an idea out there in case it makes sense to you: what if, instead of having a 2.0 DPR limit, we check the upscaling factor and decide based on that. i.e. set a 20% upscale limit.",

Developers are the ones supplying the asset variants and without knowing how we choose them won't know which ones to provide (e.g. https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/44108#issuecomment-583292205). I'd prefer not hiding these docs.\r\n\r\n> this method is not going to stand up to the test of time\r\n\r\nThat's fine, we'll just update the docs. I expect we will expand the functionality (e.g. improve physical pixel density detection, support scaled images), but I don't expect much will change otherwise as far as the developer is concerned. Provided there is no extra image scaling, this method should be pretty close to ideal (just like, provided that speeds are small enough and objects big enough, Newtonian physics is close to ideal).\r\n",
