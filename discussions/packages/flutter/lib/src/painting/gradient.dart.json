That was introduced in [this commit](https://github.com/Hixie/flutter/commit/552f26d71324e559e69a38e5ecc16c3110c580ab#diff-1756a3cb685f68e4d8f389736fda0df2R379) if it helps make sense of it?.\r\n\r\nMy best guess is it was added so that attempting to animate between gradients with different colors/stops would assert (although  `lerp` would assert in that case, so it seems redundant?)",
