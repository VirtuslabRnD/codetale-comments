I think you will need to add the gold service account, etc. to the shard that is executing the tests you would like to go through Gold. It looks like they are still skipping. `.cirrus.yml` configures the shards that use Gold: https://github.com/flutter/flutter/blob/6b11f18bc0c5a53753d1dc92928ec8ba1bdc5f95/.cirrus.yml#L90-L93",

Another thing to note is that even when the test is running, it would still fail because in `flutter_goldens`, the \"no baseline\" case[1] will only be hit when it's a new test being added.\r\n\r\nIn this case, it's not a new test, but a new \"platform\" instead. Do you think it's ok for us to ignore the failure in this PR, or should I fix the part in `flutter_goldens` as well?\r\n\r\n[1]: https://github.com/flutter/flutter/blob/master/packages/flutter_goldens/lib/flutter_goldens.dart#L513",

This will enable tryjobs. You'll be able to see all of the files you generated in pre-submit checks and bulk triage them all at once so you'll land on green. \r\n\r\nOtherwise, you would have to use the current workflow that will require an ignore rule to be put in place for every test until you can land and triage - which is a bit tedious as it is designed against making bulk changes.",

I've updated the PR with new changes in `flutter_goldens.dart` to consider the cases here as \"baseline not found\" as well, so the tests should pass now.\r\n\r\nPTAL, thanks.",
