        "body" : "I wasn't sure how to reach in and verify that the AnimatedScale and AnimatedRotation widgets themselves (or their implicitly associated AnimatedState objects) were being rebuilt so I added the next best thing which is to ensure that the test harness State object that encloses them is not rebuilt. I also upgraded other tests in the same file to use the same mechanism.\r\n\r\nWith respect to verifying the actual rotation/scale of the child, since the tests verify that there is a FooTransition object underneath them and that said FooTransition object has been updated with the correct scale/rotation, wouldn't the testing that the transform is really being applied fall to the FooTransition widget tests?",
