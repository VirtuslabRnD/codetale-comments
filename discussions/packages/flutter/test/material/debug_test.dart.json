That way if a test fails, the person reviewing the failure will know that all the other checks have passed and the only difference was a slightly probably harmless delta in the toStringDeep. For example, if there was a refactor and one ancestor changed then this test could start failing at some point for a harmless reason.",

I figured that was the best way to test it since I had to write lot of test cases and I didn't have enough time to test it in a different manner. But if you feel like it's better to test in a different manner, please feel free to do so!\r\ncmiiw? @jacob314 ",
