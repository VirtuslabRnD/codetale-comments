        "body" : "I think it's an issue with the API docs. If it doesn't have any tap/press handlers, then you can't activate the `ListTile` in any meaningful way, so if it's just got `enabled` set, but null handlers, allowing it to be focused just doesn't make any sense because you can't trigger anything. And allowing focus when `enabled` is false, but there are handlers is probably worse, since you could focus it and trigger the handlers without being able to tap on it to do that.\r\n\r\nListTile is an old widget, and I suspect we weren't as consistent about using null handlers to indicate being disabled, and so it has an `enabled` as well, which is redundant.\r\n\r\nI think \"active\" and \"interactive\" mean the same thing.",
