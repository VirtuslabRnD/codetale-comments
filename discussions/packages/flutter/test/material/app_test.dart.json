It thinks that text with scale factor 3.0 is the same size as text with a scale of 1.0 (14 px).\r\n\r\n```dart\r\n  testWidgets('Text respects textScaleFactor', (WidgetTester tester) async {\r\n    await tester.pumpWidget(const Center(\r\n        child: const Text('Hello', textScaleFactor: 3.0, textDirection: TextDirection.ltr)\r\n    ));\r\n\r\n    final RichText text = tester.firstWidget(find.byType(RichText));\r\n    expect(text.textScaleFactor, 3.0);\r\n    final Size largeSize = tester.getSize(find.byType(RichText));\r\n    expect(largeSize.height, equals(3.0 * 14.0));\r\n  });\r\n```\r\nIs this some issue with the Linux engine vs the regular engine?  Because text is clearly scaled on a device.  I just can't see how paragraph layout could work on the tests if it can't reliably determine the text size.\r\n\r\nNote that this doesn't even involve MediaQuery, so it doesn't have anything to do with that.",
