Both of those are changing though.\r\n\r\nThe new key event design will address being able to fully synthesize key events so as to be indistinguishable from key events coming from the platform, and since it's no longer platform specific, will work for all platforms.",

Ideally there would be a better mapping from physical key to logical key equivalent, but that would require knowing what the keyboard mapping is, and we don't yet have that information.\r\n\r\nAgain, this entire synthesis mechanism is meant to be replaced by the new key event code.",
