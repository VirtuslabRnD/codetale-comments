Rather than saying it's to avoid lints, I think we should say it's to convert a const literal into a non-const value, so that it can be used to call a const constructor in such a way as to create a new instance rather than creating the common const instance.\r\n\r\nAlso, we shouldn't use \"we\" or \"you\" in the docs; our style is to use the passive voice.",
