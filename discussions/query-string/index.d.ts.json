        "body" : "Ugh, `any` is a filty type in my opinion. It doesn't help the user at all while developing because it allows everything. `query-string` [doesn't allow nesting](https://github.com/sindresorhus/query-string#nesting) for example, that's why it was defined the way it was, simple shallow json objects. So no, you can't `qs.stringify` anything imo because it's not the same thing as `JSON.stringify`.\r\n\r\nIf the person who filed the PR wants to sent a DTO via a querystring (not sure why though), then it's up to him to make sure he complies with the type defined by adding something like a `toQueryString()` method for example.\r\n\r\n@sindresorhus any opinions on this one?",
