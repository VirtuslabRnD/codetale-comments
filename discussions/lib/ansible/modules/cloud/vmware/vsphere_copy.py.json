If no timeout is specified, it defaults to 10 seconds (reference: https://github.com/ansible/ansible/blob/devel/lib/ansible/module_utils/urls.py#L1148)\r\n\r\nSo, it would seem safer to me to keep the default for the parameter on 10 seconds, that's what it has always been and nobody has complained until now.\r\n\r\nHowever, if you prefer we set it to 60 now, I can live with that. Just give the word and I will make the change.",
