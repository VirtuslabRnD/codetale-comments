As-is, this module could delete an instance if someone passes `database_name=null` (or does so by accident with bad variable assignment). If I understand docs correctly, deleting an instance would delete *all* databases on that instance, which would be really unfortunate. \r\n\r\nCan you require a `force: yes` type argument to delete whole instances?
