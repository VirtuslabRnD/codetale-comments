This module does that, but then also connects to a service running _on_ the cluster itself (called the Containerized Data Importer Upload Proxy), which is why it has a completely separate set of `upload_host_*` parameters that control that.\r\n\r\nIt's probable that before The Freeze I'll be attempting to switch the default on `upload_host_verify_ssl` to _autodetect_ (aka \"look for a Secret with the certs in a standard place\") for ease of use.",
