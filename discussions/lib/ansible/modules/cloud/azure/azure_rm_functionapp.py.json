If the feature was added when the module was created it should not be defined.\r\n\r\nSetting this to the correct value will cause a CI error if `version_added` does not match the current release, but we can bypass that as CI doesn't understand options which were not originally documented.\r\n\r\nCan you open a PR to correct this and any other of the `version_added` entries?",
