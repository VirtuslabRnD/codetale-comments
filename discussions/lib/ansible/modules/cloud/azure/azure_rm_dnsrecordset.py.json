        "body" : "@yuwzho thank you for the review. If I understand you correct, you are talking about creating a new field and leaving the existing behaviour or TXT intact? If that is the case, I do not think that is required as the current implementation will not work in any case, as this will fail against the Azure RM API. In addition the usage syntax has not changed and remains the same. With that in mind, do you think it is still required to create a new field?\r\n\r\nNote that this change would still retain the behaviour where a `string` is provided as the value to the `entry`.",
