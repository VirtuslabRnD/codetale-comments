I've had a few occasions recently where I've found lacking documentation so I reckon it should be be laid out the same way.",

Through the latest commit, I have corrected these values.\r\nOnly for 'customer_gateway_configuration' field, haven't attached sample as it is a big XML string.\r\nPlease review and let me know if you would like to see any more changes.",
