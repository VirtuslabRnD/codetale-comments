        "body" : "This entire module seems incorrect- a policy can have N rules, right? It only appears that the module properly handles the zero or one rule case. This is tricky, since there appear to be no rule names, so heuristic matching of a supplied list would be required, but the module doesn't even accept a list, just a single rule and a policy name.\r\n\r\nEven if all that were solved, the modification code seems like it should behave more like the create code, with conditional addition of properties as necessary on a rule-index selected via heuristic match. \r\n\r\nIt seems like the sanest way to implement this module might be just \"here's a list of rules, make it so\", and if a change is needed, just blow away the entire export policy and rebuild it. Would at least be much simpler that way- at a glance it looks like the current implementation could not tolerate modifying an existing policy with more than one rule anyway...",
