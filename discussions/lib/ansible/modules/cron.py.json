Bold and italic are meant used to emphasize words for the benefit of the reader to know they have increased importance. Inline code indicates to the reader these are vales that will be used in code. Using italic to indicate values used in code sends confusing messages to the reader, IMO.\r\n\r\n> Hmm, since this has been the recommended way of writing things for a long time now, \r\n\r\nIt's never too late to change things for the better. ðŸ˜„ ",

        "body" : "@samdoran thanks for the feedback. If we're going to use monospace for anything that will be used in code, we need to update [our own documentation about documenting modules](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/dev_guide/developing_modules_documenting.html#linking-and-other-format-macros-within-module-documentation) and update modules across the board. I'll open an issue for that, and we'll discuss it in the [Docs WG](https://github.com/ansible/community/issues/521). I like your suggestion, but would like to see it implemented consistently, and meanwhile I'd like to get the rest of the fixes from this PR merged.",
