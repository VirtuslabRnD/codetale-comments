The point I added them here as well is that here the description should be slighly different: as opposed to the other modules, where `account_key_src` and `account_key_content` are mutually exclusive, we have the 4-group `account_key_src`, `account_key_content`, `private_key_source`, `private_key_content` for this module. Before this override, the description for these two mentioned only these two, but the description for the others mentioned all four (as well as the general description).",
