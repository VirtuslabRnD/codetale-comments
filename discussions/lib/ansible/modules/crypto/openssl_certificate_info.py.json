I haven't finished reviewing the changes though, so I realize there may be backwards compatibility/consistency issues leading to the authority_ naming convention. ",

I skimmed over the type and started implementing the `Name` approach, only then to find out during testing that it didn't want that. The result is pyca/cryptography#4973 :)",
