        "body" : "@jborean93 curious what you think about this. After our discussion on checking for properties I realized `Get-AnsibleParam` fits the bill nicely, and its description seems to do exactly what I needed. Only issue was that it requires `.ContainsKey()` on the object, even though the rest of the logic works perfectly with both objects and `[hashtable]`s, so it's helpful for these situations operating in strict mode.\r\n\r\nIf you think this is more widely useful I'd be open to moving it into `Ansible.ModuleUtils.Legacy`, or updating the logic in `Get-AnsibleParam` to just work with both objects and dictionaries.",
