        "body" : "Hey @jborean93, I decided to move the description of the `username` format down to its own lines (30-31) considering how local, domain and service users can now utilize this format, and it required a bit of explanation around the domain lookup favoring.  Happy to change things around in the docs if you think it'd be clearer expressed differently.\r\n\r\nFor the tests, we're still testing plain username without the host prefix (among others), however I changed this to target a test-generated local account rather than `Guest`.  Mostly, to be better in alignment with the strategy now used for the local administrator account (not targeting/assuming a known account by name), and also to avoid any conflation with the new domain precedence, since `Guest` exists by default both locally and in domain environments.  Though this shouldn't occur so long as Ansible tests are run against non-domain joined boxes, it is something that could testing on a domain-joined machine (as I experienced).",
