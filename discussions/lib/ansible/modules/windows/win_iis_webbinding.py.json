I actually wasn't expecting this to pass the Shippable testing until that was fixed so figured that this wouldn't come up.\r\n\r\nIt seems to only be present when people reference their servers by IP rather than host name. I'm not sure how common that is. What about adding a warning to the module description about the bug? I almost wonder if it should even be merged before that is fixed. Might be worth bringing up in the next WWG.",
