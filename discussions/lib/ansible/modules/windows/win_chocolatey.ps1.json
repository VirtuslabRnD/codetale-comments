        "body" : "While I don't think you should use this as it changes the global config, it currently doesn't work as it needs you to set `-proxy_url`, `-proxy_username`, `-proxy_password` as it is expecting those params. I don't think the `choco config set` and `choco config unset` should be used as it is a global setting and users may be unaware that setting this can affect it when they run it locally\r\n\r\nInstead I think you should use the explicit proxy settings at runtime as shown here https://chocolatey.org/docs/proxy-settings-for-chocolatey#installing-chocolatey-behind-a-proxy-server. It does have a dependency on a relatively new version of chocolatey but I think the benefits outweigh the negatives here and we can just simply say in the documentation these parameters require version `0.10.4` or newer.\r\n\r\nIf you feel really adventurous you can try and parse the version and fail if it is older and the proxy params are set.",

Support for `--proxy-bypass-list` and `--proxy-bypass-on-local` parameters should be added too.\r\n\r\nReading the docs at https://chocolatey.org/docs/proxy-settings-for-chocolatey#installing-chocolatey-behind-a-proxy-server I realize that with chololatey  0.10.4+ versions, proxy should also work through the use of the following env variables : `http_proxy`, `https_proxy`, `no_proxy` making it easier to work with proxies through ansible than it was before.\r\n\r\nAlso one question comes to mind, what happens if a proxy is globally set on chocolatey install but we don't want to use one through ansible. (weird improbable case I admit)",
