        "body" : "@s-hertel \r\n\r\nTalking with @AlanCoding and thinking about use of the `boto_profile`, which requires there be a file laid down on the system that is running `ansible-inventory`, I think this is much better for our use case in awx.\r\n\r\nWhile I understand they have overlapping functionality, using this is much less hacky than requiring people lay down files on every awx node that may run inventory update. This way we can provide credentials using standard aws credential and provide custom role to use that those credentials give access to.",
