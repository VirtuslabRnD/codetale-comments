        "body" : "The win_updates module is a complicated beast where we either need to run with become or as a scheduled task for it to be able to access the Windows Update API. The Action plugin pretty much forces become to be used with the `SYSTEM`, like root, account if become is not already set so user's don't have to do so themselves.\r\n\r\nThey still have the ability to set their own become account which is why we check on `orig_become` or use the older and more error prone scheduled task option with `use_task`.",
