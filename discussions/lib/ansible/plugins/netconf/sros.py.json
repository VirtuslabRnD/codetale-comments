        "body" : "Based on the feedback from the Ansible team (Andrius, ...) we've taken the effort building a Nokia SR OS collection that contains terminal, cliconf and netconf plugins. You might want to set this SROS plugin to \"deprecated\" while telling people to use collection \"nokia.sros\" instead.\r\n\r\nPlease provide guidance, how to change the existing plugin on galaxy, to add the device handler reference!\r\n\r\nMotivation:\r\nUsing collections on Galaxy allows Nokia to update the content more frequently while distributing changes (fixes/improvements, new features) to the community outside regular Ansible release cycles. Also we do not rely anymore on the God's mercy that changes contributed by us get merged back into Ansible.\r\n\r\nAlso the message we've received is saying, that in the future all vendor specific code will be removed from Ansible core and need to be moved to Galaxy anyhow.",

        "body" : "Most of the content is planned to be cut out from the ansible core before the next ansible release. After the cut out happens the only location sros plugin will reside is in `nokia.sros` collection, so no need to mark the existing plugin in core as deprecated. Since we are in the transition phase it needs to be maintained at both places for some time until the content cutout happens. \r\n\r\nAs per your comment, I will change the value from `alu` to `default` in this PR\r\n\r\nIn your collection update the `DOCUMENTATION` section in netconf plugin similar to what is added in this PR and test it after applying this PR in your environment.
