        "body" : "IIRC this behavioral disconnect was because the two features were added at different times. My original assumption was that the collections path would remain a relatively short list of dirs, so allowing the normal Python behavior of \"stuff can appear later and it's fine\" to continue was OK, but when we started putting `sys.path` into the mix, I wanted to scan it only once, because it's not uncommon for `sys.path` to have hundreds of generated entries in it, and I didn't want the collection loader having to scan all that all the time. Off the top of my head, I don't really see a problem moving the whole thing to \"if there's no ansible_collections package in it when we fire it up, just ignore it\".",
