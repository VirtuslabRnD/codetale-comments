The API has changed in only one subtle way in the past few releases (the default error handler changed from surrogate_or_replace to surrogate_then_replace as I found one cornercase where surrogate_or_replace could traceback).\r\n\r\nthe to_* methods make encoding issues and conversion from bytes and text much simpler than trying to ad hoc a solution.  And as a bonus, as long as it's marked unstable, I've been reviewing the code that uses it to make sure I fix them if I make any changes that would break (so far I've been lucky on that front.  the only things I've had to change were when I first introduced the functions and only a few things were using them).  Once I declare the interface stable I'll have to create new versions of the functions if I make backwards incompatible changes and then I'll rely more heavily on maintainers to port to new versions on a deprecation cycle.",
