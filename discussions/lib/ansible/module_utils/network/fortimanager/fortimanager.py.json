The pyFMG classes were obfuscated by this code in mod_utils/fortimanager.py, and in turn those classes in mod_utils called by older modules. In addition our current modules that have already been PR'd, still need to use this code. Until we PR new versions of existing modules, this code needs to exist. ",
