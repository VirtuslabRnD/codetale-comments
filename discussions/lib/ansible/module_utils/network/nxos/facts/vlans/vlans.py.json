        "body" : "@trishnaguha Hi Trishna. Mike and I are pushing back on this request. This module was very broken except for rudimentary test cases. It now works on _all_ of our regression testbeds and images, with a more comprehensive (and complex) set of test cases, with the exception of the 6.2 image you referenced. We would like to see this PR merged since it fixes so many issues, and open a new issue to address the legacy/EOL limitation separately. I added a TBD to the facts code with a suggested resolution for that. Thanks. ",
