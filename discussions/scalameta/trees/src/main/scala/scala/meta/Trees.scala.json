What dialect do we choose then?\n\nHowever, what I think should be done is prohibiting trees like and types, or types, non-trivial trait constructors in contexts, where Scala211 is expected. For example, if you try to prettyprint such a tree in a Scala211 context, an exception must be thrown.\n\nWdyt?\n",

However, I think scala.meta should **never** throw exceptions. I would prefer to have a `.validate(dialect)` method that I can call before `.syntax`. We can discussÂ different strategies later. \n",
