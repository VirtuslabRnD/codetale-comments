        "body" : "Yes; I've been looking at utilization over the last week and have never seen more than 6 concurrent Windows jobs running. There have sometimes been a bit more Linux jobs (I've seen 17 running + queued at one point), but they dissolve quickly back to 6 or less (this is because of the \"other\" Linux jobs: collect build data, check standard change label, etc.).\r\n\r\nIt's also part of the experiment for sizing the macOS pool: if we switch to 6 machines for Linux & Windows and nobody complains it means 6 would also be a good size for the macOS one.",
