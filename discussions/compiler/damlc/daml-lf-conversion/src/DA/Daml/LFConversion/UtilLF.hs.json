It may look like there's duplication here, but there really isn't. \r\n\r\nThe reason is the implementation here is just replacing the case where you want to compare a builtin type, because that's what is needed in tagToEnum# and that's all that is available for older LF versions. OTOH, the implementation in Primitives.hs is exposing new functionality (comparison of types that are not builtin) when it is available. If I really wanted to unify these I would have to introduce a compiler error for the case where this function is called on a non-builtin type in older LF versions.",
