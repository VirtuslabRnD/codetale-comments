        "body" : "Not relevant here since this is just a test but once we start moving towards a library for generic templates (docs are somewhere in the middle), I’m not a fan of relying on `HasField` instances here. E.g. consider your test below where you only have self-issued assets. You can’t make a type just for those since you force users to have both `issuer` and `owner` fields separately.\r\nA more compelling example would be a type where `amount` can be derived from other quantities but you force users to have a redundant field that can get out of sync.",
