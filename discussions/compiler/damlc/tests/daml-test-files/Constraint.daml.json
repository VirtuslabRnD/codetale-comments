I think such a definition makes no sense at all but for some reason we decided to support. I agree that we should deprecate it. I'll have a look how it interacts with data-dependencies.",

But it makes zero sense to me. I don't see any reason why you would want to stuff the dictionary into the record rather than inject it whenever you call a typeclass method given that the `a` is universally quantified and not existential. ðŸ¤”",

The error message I get is\r\n```\r\n  error:\r\n  parse error on input â€˜$â€™\r\n  Perhaps you intended to use TemplateHaskell\r\nFailed to compile interface for data-dependency: foo-0.0.1\r\n```\r\nTo me, this looks like we're trying to put an identifier starting with a dollar symbol somewhere in the DAML file we're using to reconstruct the interface. Given that this feature is gated by either `ExistentialQuantification` or `GADTs`, which will both cause warnings about incompatibility with data-dependencies in the next SDK, I suggest we do exactly nothing about this. cc @sofiafaro-da",
