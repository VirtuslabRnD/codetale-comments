        "body" : "I agree with @cocreature here. Recompiling the compiler and the SDK for each experiment isn't really a good idea. It's not only extremely slow but also has the potential to introduce unrelated compilation artifacts into the benchmarks. By exposing all of these unstable functions for the same target (1.dev), we're always testing the same SDK, compiler, stdlib packages, and the only question is \"do these primitives result in a significant improvement\"? (That said, we don't currently have a way to make any conclusions about statistical significance in DAML. All we can do is eyeball it . . .)\r\n\r\nThe point of `DAML_UNSTABLE` is that it's only available for those working on 1.dev and it's 100% not a stable interface, so it's perfect for this kind of experimentation. We already have different parts of the stdlib that depending on the LF target (see Numeric, GenMap, AnyTemplate, etc features), because otherwise we would have to drop support for older LF versions.",
