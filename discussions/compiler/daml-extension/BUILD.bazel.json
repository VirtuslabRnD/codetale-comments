        "body" : "From my observations, it looks like what is slow is getting files from Bazel (specifically lots of small files). I suspect this has something to do with symlinks and may be faster on Linux.\r\n\r\nSo getting `node_modules` one file at a time, as currently done in the `node_deps_cache` rule, takes a _long_ time (we're talking ~80s on my machine for about 60MB across 3k files), whereas fetching one tarball from Bazel and extracting that \"locally\" (as currently done by the `vsix` rule) is about as fast as I'd expect, i.e. practically instant.\r\n\r\nI don't really have a good explanation for why (except that hunch about symlinks), but there it is. I do not observe any speed-up attributable to caching if I inline the logic from `node_deps_cache` into `vsix`*. This is in fact what I started with; this is not a case of premature optimization, I had written the slow version first.\r\n\r\n*: Other than caching the whole result of the genrule, obviously. But when I change the text of the genrule, even for steps that happen strictly after that point, I get the full 80s again if the fetching of files is inline.",
