I think a note in the first paragraph that you can dive into sub-directories (especially `salt/`) for lots more information would help people know where to look for further documentation. (I worry that a project newbie wouldn't know specifically to look in `cluster/saltbase/salt/` to find the detailed docs you just wrote!)\n",

Now that I've read some amount of salt documentation, I see that `salt/`, `pillar/`, and `reactor/` are the three main directory trees of salt, so perusing into those specifics is obvious if you know what you're looking for. If you don't know about salt, they seem like completely arbitrary names, and one is immediately motivated to move a directory up and not keep looking.\n\nI guess it depends who you're writing this documentation for. If it's people that know about salt, you needn't say anything more. If it's for salt newbies, some motivation for looking further is needed.\n\nAnyway, I think the links you've added give a nice balance, so this looks good. Just wanted to provide a bit of context that may seem obvious for someone who is knee deep in salt.\n",
