        "body" : "This is another reason why the Prometheus Operator is a good idea here. Running the alertmanager as a deployment is a bad idea, it delivers notifications about alerts and therefore needs to be the most reliable thing in your cluster. With a simple `Deployment` you're not getting any of the high availability features that you want, such as persistent storage and controlled rolling deployments.",
