The individual commands(heat, swift, nova, etc) appear to have more stable arguments and flags. However there were concerns about them being deprecated, and indeed in the most recent versions of the individual commands a huge, distracting deprecation notice was displayed every time a command was issued.\n\nThere will always be restrictions for the version of the client, and the restrictions are listed in the documentation, and SHOULD in the future be checked by this provider.\n",
