On workers kube-proxy is run manually, and the `--master` flag is set by the bash script\n\nI'll fix it up now on the way to v1.4, but we should discuss about a general solution that is configurable and works for everyone, and move to that solution... I know there are lots of threads about that already.\n",

        "body" : "Hi Lucas, I brought this issue up with Mike last week. I think part of the problem is that the bash script only runs kube-proxy on the workers if running <1.3.0-alpha.5 . I'm currently running 1.3.0-beta.1, but once beta.3 comes out with this PR maybe it'll be fixed. Though I suspect the bash script will need to be adjusted to run the kube-proxy again, since it's not in a DaemonSet any more.\n",
