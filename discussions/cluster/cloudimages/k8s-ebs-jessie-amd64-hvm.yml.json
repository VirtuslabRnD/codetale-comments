        "body" : "The empty block here means \"install ntp and don't change the default nameservers\".  As it stands, this is actually equivalent to just adding ntp to the package list.\n\nThe default NTP servers on debian jessie are:\n\n```\nserver 0.debian.pool.ntp.org iburst\nserver 1.debian.pool.ntp.org iburst\nserver 2.debian.pool.ntp.org iburst\nserver 3.debian.pool.ntp.org iburst\n```\n\nAWS does have NTP servers, but they are also just drawn from the public NTP servers.  Documented here: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/set-time.html\n\n> Note: The n.amazon.pool.ntp.org DNS records are intended to load balance NTP traffic from AWS. However, these are public NTP servers in the pool.ntp.org project, and they are not owned or managed by AWS. There is no guarantee that they are geographically located near your instances, or even within the AWS network. For more information, see http://www.pool.ntp.org/en/.\n\nI kept the empty ntp block because I figure (1) the plugin may do more in future and (2) it'll be clearer if we have a GCE image which will have a useful configuration block.\n",
