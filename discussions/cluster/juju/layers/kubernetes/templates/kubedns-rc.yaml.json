The current code renders templates at deploy time and we insert the architecture that the master is running on. So our template needs an architecture variable. I asked you about this on slack and we would have to address all calling cases which is a much larger pull request that is outside the scope of getting current with kubedns. \n\nIs this change OK to review?\n",
