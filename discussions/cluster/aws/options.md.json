That way we're saying the default-value is \"something vaguely sensible for the version you're installing\", rather than claiming that <50 always be t2.micro etc.  In particular, I'm thinking about whether if we changed to the m3 series whether that would be considered a change that we should highlight, or just part of our regular ongoing improvements \n\nJust a nit though; this looks great.\n",
