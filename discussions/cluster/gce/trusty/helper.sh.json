Later if a PR breaking GCI is cherry picked to release-1.2, we will have to make 3 PR: one for fixing master branch cluster/gce/gci, one for fixing master branch cluster/gce/trusty, and another for cherry-pick into cluster/gce/trusty in release-1.2. If we only keep gci-specific code in master branch, it is hard to cherry-pick into release-1.2 as there is no dir cluster/gce/gci\n",
