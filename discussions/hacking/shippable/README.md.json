Here's the link for devel:\r\n\r\nhttps://app.shippable.com/github/ansible/ansible/runs?branchName=devel\r\n\r\nUntil development resumes on `devel` you'll want to look at `temp-2.10-devel` instead:\r\n\r\nhttps://app.shippable.com/github/ansible/ansible/runs?branchName=temp-2.10-devel\r\n\r\nHowever, it's likely that the run has failed results, so you'll need to re-run the failed jobs. However, those will show up as triggered by the user who restarted them, which means multiple people trying to go through this process on the same day may each end up re-running the failed jobs.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately there's not an easy way to deal with this currently. It should be possible to create a script using the Shippable API to find the latest nightly run, taking into account re-runs, so you'll know which one to use.",
