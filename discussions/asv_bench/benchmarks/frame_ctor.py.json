It _should_ be easy to deduplicate based on shared `setup()`, but I couldn't find any good documentation on how to heavily edit the AST like this.\n\nBasically, my approach would be to do one pass with the existing fix-ups, then create a mapping of `{setup(): [class nodes with setup()]}`, and do a second pass to merge similar class nodes. What I couldn't find docs on was a concise way to move/delete entire nodes so all the similar classes could be merged into a single class.\n",
