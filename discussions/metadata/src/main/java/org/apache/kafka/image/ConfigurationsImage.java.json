        "body" : "Eventually it would be good to transition away from using the `Properties` class, I think. It's a weird old Java 1.0 (or whatever) thing with a lot of odd behaviors. One example is that its default encoding for writing out to a file is ISO-8859-1 (Latin-1), which I guess made sense in the 1990s, but not today. Because of their decision to inherit from HashTable (now deprecated) you can also insert non-string values, which behave in ways that can only be described as \"incorrect\" (like appearing as null when accessed by `getProperty`).\r\n\r\nBut, a bunch of other parts of the code use `Properties` for entity configurations, so we have to support it, for now.",
