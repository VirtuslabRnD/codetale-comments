People don't usually expect cache keys to be super sensitive.\r\n\r\nI agree the separator is likely not an actual bug *in this particular case*, but if you use the struct approach everywhere you prevent an entire class of really hard to find bugs, some of which are serious security problems.\r\n\r\nI will likely file an issue about these items.",
