So a friend kubelet wont populate this metric with anything until its first certificate rotation. For shielded nodes this will be <10 days. Hypthetically for a kubelet that has been around for a long the histogram will observe the data:\r\n[~10days, ~10days, ~10days, ...]\r\n\r\nDoes that answer your question?",
