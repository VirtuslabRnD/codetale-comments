        "body" : "> the same question for normal Unmount function.\r\n\r\nFor normal unmount it is bit problematic to change behaviour for all existing drivers. As we know that some storage types flush pending writes when a volume is unmounted - and hence unmount time could vary and it is not safe to kill unmount process when this happens. So I think we never want to use a universal timeout for normal unmount function for all drivers. \r\n\r\n> so should we consider to have a timeout even for force unmount?\r\n\r\nforce works best for unreachable NFS system. It is documented directly in the man page. But it is not guaranteed to not hang  and as far as I know if it hangs in other cases, it could be hanging for a legitimate reason (such as volume being used or something else) and in those cases using a timeout will basically kill the unmount process and it could be problematic. So, I think I would not want to use a timeout for force unmount. It could result in a leaked goroutine but that is okay (it is okay because we are not going to retry unmount if previous unmount is hung), we always leaked goroutines in this code path. \r\n\r\n",
