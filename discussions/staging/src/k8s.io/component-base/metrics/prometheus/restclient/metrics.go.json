        "body" : "i went back and forth with myself on `call_status` vs `error_type`. i think i landed on `call_status` since it better matched the metric name (`rest_client_exec_plugin_*call*_total`) and so we could get away with 3 enum values for this field instead of 4. i figured that if someone wanted to filter down to all the unsuccessful executions, they could just say `exitCode != 0 && call_status == plugin_called`.\r\n\r\ni'm not totally wed to this. i'll switch it over to `no_error` and just let me know if you change your mind: 9e947251851a1b44ae4c7c11457932cf151b1467",

Its not that significantly different than 1 day in my mind.\r\n\r\n> do we need something between 1 year and 4 years?\r\n\r\nAgain I don't think so but if you feel strongly I can add it. I figure 1+ year rotation cadence is way too slow no need to capture a range of _way too slow_ rotations. I added 4 years to get a picture of the outlier certs that finally rotated after a super long time.",
