        "body" : "@liggitt @msau42 I agree with that sentiment. Code duplication has a certain stink that I'm not fond of. On the other hand, I've been talking about getting this code removed for almost two years now, and I'd like to finally follow through on that promise.\r\n\r\nThe options would be to:\r\n\r\n1. Hold the change until https://github.com/kubernetes/utils/pull/100 lands then make the appropriate changes to use that library\r\n2. Merge the change and if the utils patch merges switch the library over before code freeze if possible.\r\n\r\nMy preference is 2. In my mind we're making things slightly worse in the short term to make the much better in the long term. The risk is that we adopt this bit of stink then never revisit it, but I'll take responsibility for making sure that doesn't happen.",

It has test coverage in CI, but only because it is used by volume types available in CI environments.
