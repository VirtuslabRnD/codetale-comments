        "body" : "Exactly what I had in mind.\r\n\r\nThere is an implication you should be aware of: `null` is generally rejected as an inhabitant of `Name`, in other words `null: Name` fails at type-checking, not wartremover. However, IIUC `ofDim` effectively backdoors a `null` inhabitant. This isn't really enough of a bother to avoid this, necessarily (you can also get a `null` inhabitant by getting the 0th item of an empty java ArrayList), but worth keeping in mind.\r\n\r\nWe might also want to provide a `CanBuildFrom[Array[_], T, Array[T]]` instance, but see my other comment.",
