        "body" : "Thanks for starting this conversation. I meant to debate about this but somehow missed it while sending this PR.\n\nMy arguments to self so far:\n1. `jq` is really easy to install. It is in the upstream repos of popular Linux distributions. No additional repositories needed, just `apt-get install jq`, `dnf install jq` and so on. There are packages and/or binaries readily available for Mac, Windows and other platforms - https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/. So it is not that much of a hassle IMO.\n2. And it is required only for dev environments. We will not require `jq` in the shipped release/distribution.\n3. It is not doing something special that we cannot accomplish with `sed`, but the intent is so much clear with `jq`. Also, it guarantees that it modifies only that particular JSON object we intend to modify and not accidentally modify some other field which matches the regexp.\n\nPlease let me know your thoughts. Open to suggestions.\n",
