Whatever your preference.\r\n\r\nI suppose it could even be a little faster because `Object.values()` doesn't walk the prototype chain but that's probably only a marginal benefit (and I didn't test so my intuition might very well be wrong.)",

I know we were trying to be more on the conservative side when it comes to introducing ES* features to benchmarks because of possible incompatibilities with older branches. For example, `Object.values()` does not exist in node v4.x or v6.x (although it's apparently behind a flag in recent v6.x releases).",
