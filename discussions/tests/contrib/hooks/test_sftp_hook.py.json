        "body" : "Again the problem is that I changed the user from airflow to root (reason explained below). So i had to change the test to use root user rather than airflow - since the sftp server we use in docker is started using the system credentials. I figured that using root for the time of test only is a good solution. We still have airflow user in the CI image, so I could change it but then I would need some extra modifications in the startup scripts. I figured it is easier to do it this way. Do you think it is so bad to having to rework it?",
