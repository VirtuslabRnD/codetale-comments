However, I realized (I hope correctly), that this will actually implicitly test the same thing. If for some reason the references returned are out of order, this expected mapping with the string representation of what we gave the test won't match later on when we assert that the references returned match this. Let me know if this is indeed a good enough test for the actual ordering.",
