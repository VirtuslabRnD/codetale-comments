        "body" : "I agree with the principle that we should reproduce the user-facing situation instead of testing against implementation details. My concern with reproducing the exact scenario is that we'll end up with a flaky test. \r\n\r\nIt's critical that we reset the presentation compiler for getting good user experience and I think it will be helpful in the future to have `isLoaded()` as a toolkit to test related fixes. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
