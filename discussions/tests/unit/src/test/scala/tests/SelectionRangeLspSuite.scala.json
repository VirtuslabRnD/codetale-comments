We could reuse them later for Scala 3 and we can create a lot of smaller cases.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n```scala\r\nobject Main extends App {\r\n  val name: Option[String] = Option(\"Tom\")\r\n  name match {\r\n    case Some(name) => println(\"Hello! \" + name)\r\n    case None =>\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThis one seem particulary weird, since we get range on `case Some(name) => println(\"Hello! \" + name)` and then with whitespaces before.\r\n\r\nIs that maybe a tree node that we can skip?\r\n",
