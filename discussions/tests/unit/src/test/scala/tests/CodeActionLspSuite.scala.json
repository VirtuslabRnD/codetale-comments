You have three main elements:\r\n\r\n- the input text (using `@@` as the cursor position)\r\n- the expected list of code actions (I'm checking the `title` property of code actions)\r\n- the expected text after applying one of the code actions (I'm selecting the first one by default, but it's configurable)\r\n\r\nThis can be expanded to support other common test cases, but I think it's a decent start",
