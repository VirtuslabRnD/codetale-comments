The `Foldable` instance should be easy to check with something like [this](https://github.com/non/cats/blob/master/tests/src/test/scala/cats/tests/OneAndTests.scala#L31-L35) where you put only a `Foldable` but not a `Traverse` instance into the implicit scope. I don't think we have a handy helper for `Coflatmap`, so that might just require an explicit call to fetch the `Coflatmap` instance.\n\nYou've already done a lot with this PR. If you'd prefer, I'm happy to add these afterwards.\n",

So when you check `TraverseTests`, you are validating that your `Traverse` instance is law-abiding (including the `Foldable` laws), but the separate `Foldable` instance that you have defined isn't getting checked at all. It's a subtle issue that as of now requires a fair amount of boilerplate in our tests :(\n",
