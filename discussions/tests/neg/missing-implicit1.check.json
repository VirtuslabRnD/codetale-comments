This could be improved in a later PR but I believe it would be even better if all the necessary imports were mentioned (but we might need to think about how to nicely display all the combinations to the userâ€¦).",

It still lists only the single import needed for the toplevel given instance, but if that is not enough will state that the imports \"make progress towards fixing the problem\" rather than \"fix the problem\". If the user then adds the import, they will see the next necessary import in the next compilation run.",
