In this particular example we're drilling down three paths, each of which end with T not being assignable to U. We could attempt to eliminate paths that have already been elaborated from the error reporting (perhaps by simply dropping elaborations that are already present in the diagnostic chain), but that's really an issue that is orthogonal to this PR.",
