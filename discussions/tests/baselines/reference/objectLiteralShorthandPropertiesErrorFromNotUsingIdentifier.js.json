We only check if nodes are on the same line if they have the same parent container. \r\n\r\nIt looks like the logic for checking if there is a parent set has been introduced as part of the following refactoring (not sure if this was intentional; or if it's reasonable to continue doing that). https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/commit/68b0323b72bf51236d8cd181ed94ba9a63f933fd.",
