        "body" : "This is what I was concerned about and why I indicated we should add the test. One of my arguments for `static {}` was that it ensured the class declaration was fully initialized before its export binding was instantiated, so that you don't see a partially initialized class in a circular import scenario. Its fine for now, since we also incorrectly emit static field initializers after the binding is instantiated. The export binding issue can be investigated in a separate PR.",
