        "body" : "While working on this, I found a need for the js declaration emitter to automatically add/strip export modifiers from nested namespace members as needed; so the result of this can be seen in some baseline updates like this - since every member of the containing namespace was `export`ed, there was no need to explicitly have the `export` modifiers. Now they get stripped, consistent with our transform-based declaration emitter.",
