        "body" : "Two orthogonal issues:\r\n\r\nFirst, we could do extra work to omit the word `possibly` when the type is *exactly* `null` or `undefined`. However, it is very rare for someone to *explicitly* use `null` or `undefined` as an operand, so it's not clear that it really matters all that much. This is the type of error that only surfaces in a test.\r\n\r\nSecond, we could consider using the word `value` instead of `object` when reporting for expression operands--but it's really the same error that we use for `obj.foo` where `obj` may be null or undefined. The downside would be error message searchability, but since the error is pretty obvious that may not be an issue.",
