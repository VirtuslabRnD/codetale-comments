FWIW, I prefer this sequence—skipping `{Set<T>}`—because for one of these tags that takes a type, you always want the curly braces. Suppose that in\r\n\r\n```js\r\n/**\r\n * @returns {string}\r\n */\r\n```\r\n\r\nyou selected `{string}` and were going to type something else—I think everything you could want to type would still start with `{`, so I think it would be best to jump from `string` to `@returns {string}`.",
