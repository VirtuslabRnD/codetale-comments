Is this what you had in mind?\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n// @strict: true\r\n// @target es6\r\n\r\nclass A {\r\n    #foo: number;\r\n}\r\n\r\nclass B {\r\n    #foo: number;\r\n}\r\n\r\nconst b: A = new B();     // Error: Property #foo is missing\r\n```\r\n\r\nI looked at the tests for `private` modifier and didn't see examples with structural comparison. Would you be able to point me toward what you had in mind? Thanks for your help.\r\n\r\nThe privateNamesInGenericClasses tests were recommended by a TS team member. They are intended to show that we didn't mess up handling of generics. That is, that C<number> isn't assignable to C<string>, even though the private name is the same in this case.\r\n\r\n",
