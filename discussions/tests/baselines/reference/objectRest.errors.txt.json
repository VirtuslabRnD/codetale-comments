The existing errors indicate that rest *won't* remove 'a' and 'b' because they actually have type string, but the new error makes it look like the resulting type is `{}`, indicating that the rest *did* remove 'a' and 'b'.\n\nProbably the place to start is to declare a new variable instead of trying to redeclare `o`. I don't know if that was intentional in the original test.",

Now we actually factor them in, and when a computed property has type `string` (i.e. a non-unit type) we remove _all_ properties from the rest type because we have no idea which ones were actually removed. This mirrors what `Pick<T, Exclude<keyof T, string>>` does.",
