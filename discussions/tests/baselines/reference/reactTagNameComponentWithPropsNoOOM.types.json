We definitely want to see the shorter form in places like declaration emit and quickinfo, but not in the typewriter as it makes it harder to verify that our tests/proofs are valid.\r\n\r\nI'd be fine with seeing the origin type if it's nested inside another type (like an inferred type of `() => typeof React.ReactHTML`, etc.), but when our type writer writes the type of the symbol itself we should see the normalized type so we can verify the test proves our expectations, otherwise we may introduce regressions we'll miss due to the aliasing here.",
