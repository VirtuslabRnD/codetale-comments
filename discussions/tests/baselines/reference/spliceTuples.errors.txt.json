        "body" : "So I keep reading this error and coming to it feeling kinda lacking in information.  Maybe something like \r\n```suggestion\r\n!!! error TS2322:   Type '[number, string, boolean, ...boolean[]]' provides no match for required element at position 3 in type '[number, string, boolean, boolean, ...boolean[]]'.\r\n\r\n```\r\nI feel like yeah, we work with source/target all the time in the compiler, sure, but I think having the types right there, inline, make it easier to take in. It'd also be neat if we could, like, underline or highlight the tuple element we're referring to somehow, like\r\n```\r\n\r\n!!! error TS2322:   Type '[number, string, boolean, ...boolean[]]' provides no match for required element at position 3 in type '[number, string, boolean, boolean, ...boolean[]]'.\r\n                                                    ~~~~~~~~~~~~                                                                                           ~~~~~~~\r\n```\r\nbecause referring to a tuple element index across two tuples, while concrete, feels like it can be hard to pick out what pair of elements are being compared when the tuples are long. Though that last part (the underlining) we can discuss/consider implementing another time. I do think restoring a slightly more detailed error message is warranted, however.",
