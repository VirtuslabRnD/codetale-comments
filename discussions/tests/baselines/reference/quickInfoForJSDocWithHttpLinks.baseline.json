In `master`, you can repro this by defining `class https` instead of `type https`, so it's not related to this PR.\r\n2. My intention for `@link` support is primarily to link to in-compilation entities, not URLs. People use markdown links for that already (and Code supports it).\r\n\r\nIf the editor experience breaks when `https` is in scope, the author can remove that declaration or switch to using the markdown format for links. I think the current behaviour is fine and this test of a corner case shows it off.",
