It looks like the `mock_conf_get` decorator / context manager isn't used anywhere, and handles fewer cases than the decorator I added, so I'm proposing to delete it and just use the new code. I also simplified the proposed new decorator--I didn't know that `contextlib.contextmanager` produces a function that's both a decorator and a context manager.",
