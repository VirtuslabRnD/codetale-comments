The syntax `$` for types won't exist outside of patterns and hence they will have a single option and won't be able to get confused about this at the use site. The use of `$` in the pattern is its own issue (see #10050) which we will address separately. Here we focus on the use sites and keep the changes to the patterns to a minimum.",
