I actually think in this case, it's a little better as is, since we want to start the broker with different versions during the test.\r\n\r\nWe could still do it, but then we'd have to stop the broker and upgrade it and restart it during the test, or only start zk in startUp and start the broker during the tests... I think in this case, it's a more complicated control flow in the tests in exchange for diminishing returns.\r\n\r\nI can totally get it for tests that just need zk and kafka running and don't care about the version, but in this case, I think I like it better flat.",
