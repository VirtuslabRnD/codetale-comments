        "body" : "I'm not sure what you mean by \"unintended positive\". `void` was wrong and `any` is right as far as I can tell.\r\n\r\nI think, in most positions, inferring `any` vs `unknown` is a matter of preference -- how strict do you want the result to be? Right now I assume that people want pretty loose results, since I expect people will use this after converting from .js to .ts, and before trying to get rid of any explicit `any`.\r\n\r\nWe could discuss adding another fix to the codefix, one that defaults to `unknown` when possible. I think it would be a decent idea, but hard to explain in the space of a codefix title.",
