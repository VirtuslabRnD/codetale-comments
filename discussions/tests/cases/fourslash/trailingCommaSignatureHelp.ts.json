        "body" : "Previously this test was wrong -- the `edit.insert` call applied to the start of the file, changing the first line to `str(2,|function str(n: number): string;` and eliminating that overload. The correct behavior still *has* two overloads, but shows the one with higher arity first.\r\n\r\nAs for the second test showing `{}` instead of `number`, that's because in signature help, we assume a trailing comma indicates trying to write another argument, which means `chooseOverload` fails and we go to `getCandidateForOverloadFailure` which doesn't infer type arguments.",
