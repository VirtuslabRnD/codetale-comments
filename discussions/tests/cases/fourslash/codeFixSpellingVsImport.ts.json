But if you have `import { foo1 } from \"mod\";`, we don't want to correct all `foo2` to `foo1` if `foo2` actually does exist. The difference in the latter case is we actually do know that `foo2` is a valid name, it just wasn't imported; whereas in the property declaration case we have no evidence that there was ever supposed to be a second property.",
