I could not figure out what change in this PR affected this.\r\n\r\nIn master it fails with `value stripMargin2 is not a member of String` because `a` is not and `inline` `String`. But for some reason in this PR `stripMargin2` is accepted as a member of `a` and skips the check that `a` should be an inline parameter. It should fail before inlining the code.",
