Such consumers will probably not be happy with the numeric labels, so we could also consider blowing up instead.\r\n\r\nHowever:\r\n- there is no formal spec for this format\r\n- in the context of navigator, the field names should always be available\r\n- even if they weren't, it will only produce slightly awkward results in the front end, and not really break anything\r\n\r\nSo the code is fine as is.",
