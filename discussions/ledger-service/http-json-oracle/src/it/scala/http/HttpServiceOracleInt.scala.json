This is probably fine for this PR but we probably want to revisit this and use a proper test fixture that creates a fresh db (or rather schema because oracle :shrug:) and cleans it up afterwards.",

        "body" : "There is a difference between the two in that Postgres tests are expected to be run by anyone, including someone who has done zero setup of a local Postgres installation, whereas Oracle tests will only be run by CI or someone deliberately set up for Oracle. As such, I believe we should depend on setup carried out on the prebuilt environment wherever this eases maintenance.",
