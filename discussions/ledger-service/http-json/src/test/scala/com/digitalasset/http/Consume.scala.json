        "body" : "I considered whether `Free` was really appropriate here, and it ultimately came down to things like this. Interpreting these scripts must pause when reaching a `readOne` (`Listen` here). However, a naive interpretation will interpret a `flatMap`\r\n\r\n```scala\r\n  [e] (first: Consume[T, e], next: e => Consume[T, V]) => ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nby recursive descent into `first`. However, should it encounter `Listen` on this recursive descent, what then? Assuming it's the second listen encountered, it must immediately stop, returning it _and all the remaining actions_, including the ones unpacked as we recur.\r\n\r\nBy contrast, in this code, `f: T => Free[Consume[T, ?], V]`, where the function result represents the complete remainder of the sequence, _regardless of how arbitrarily nested within `first`s this `Listen` was_. That is the result of `resume`; in other words, the key feature we needed was turning every left-associated bind `(fx >>= k) >>= t` into a right-associated bind `fx >>= (\\x -> k x >>= t)`, exactly what `Free` and `resume` are designed for, thus permitting scripts to be factored in a natural way.",
