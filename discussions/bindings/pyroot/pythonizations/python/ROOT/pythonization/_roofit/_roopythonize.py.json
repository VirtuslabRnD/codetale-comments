        "body" : "I know you copy-pasted this ```Docstring``` line from the existing `_fitTo` function, but as Axel said this is not very meaningful just like that with no information.\r\n\r\nFor the existing `fitTo` function, it was there because we wanted to see if the docstring mechanism works in principle, i.e. that it gets shown when you type `?RooAbsReal.plotOn` in an ipython shell. Well, that worked, but we still have not figured out if we need such a docstring and what it should contain.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that the docstring should in principle document the function in all detail, but a detailed documentation already exists from the C++ code via doxygen. However, both the duplication of documentation and leaving the docstring empty are not good solutions for me.\r\n\r\nSo in conclusion, it's not clear yet what the docstring should contain yet, but I'll make sure we converge to a good solution before the next release. For this very welcome first PR of yours, I'm fine with this placeholder.",
