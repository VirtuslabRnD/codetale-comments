However, I think at least make and cmake should stay, as most likely people will want those to use ROOT with their own code. You could create different variants of ROOT packages, for example, with few or many dependencies by changing what's installed at the time you build ROOT and the package, and/or changing this list.",

What gets enabled at build time then determines which dependencies the package has, so if you want a full featured ROOT, just enable everything you can at build time, and CPack will add the dependencies when you create the DEB or RPM by inspecting what has been linked into the shared libraries. For that to work, however, you cannot use any builtins when building ROOT.",
