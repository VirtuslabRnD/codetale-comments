If we don’t want to diagnose (without imposing naming convention) that’s fine.\r\n\r\nWe should work very hard to hide the name of the dictionary. It contains intricate information for the library such as locations of header files and rdict files and so on. We have an option how to build multiple dictionaries for a single library—if that does not work we should fix it. Allowing the user to decide which dictionary gets attached to which library and when is a source of big issues and it is very subtle bugs. Essentially the dictionary is a ROOT implementation detail which can affect the core of the framework majorly. \r\n\r\nWe should encourage people to use the ROOT_STANDARD_LIBRARY_PPACKAGE and we should not use a standalone ROOT_GENERATE_DICTIONARY standalone.
