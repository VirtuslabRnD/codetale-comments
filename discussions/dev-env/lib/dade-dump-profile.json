My main intent is to share these variables across CI and a normal development setup without having to define these separately (as it was done so far in `ci/build.yml`). If you feel that these variables belong somewhere else I'm happy to move it, but I thing it would be beneficial to leave these in a place where they are shared across CI and a normal development setup without ad-hoc ways of defining them.
