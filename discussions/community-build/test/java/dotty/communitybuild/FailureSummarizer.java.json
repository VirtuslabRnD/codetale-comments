Meanwhile this PR is already a great improvement even if we have to rely on some hacks so I'd be happy to get it in.\r\nAnother approach we might to explore would be using the github annotation API to get info from failed tests reported back in the github UI, there's some github actions to do this based on the XML reports that JUnit generates but I haven't tried them: https://github.com/marketplace/actions/junit-report-to-annotations, https://github.com/marketplace/actions/junit-report",
