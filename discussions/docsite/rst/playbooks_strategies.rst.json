It seems like it would be easy for people to miss that linear is parallel within a task and that serial is related to that within-a-play parallelism.\n\nfree's parallelism could then be defined in contrast to that.  I'm also not sure what effect serial might have if the strategy was free.  Is that an error?  Does it force linear strategy behaviour?\n",
