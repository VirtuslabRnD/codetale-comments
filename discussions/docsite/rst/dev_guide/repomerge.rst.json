The two module repos will be essentially locked, though they will be kept in place for the existing 2.1 and 2.2 dependencies. Once 2.2 moves out of official support (early 2018), these repositories will be fully readonly for all branches. Until then, any issues/PRs opened there will be auto-closed with a note to open it on `ansible/ansible <https://github.com/ansible/ansible/>`_.\n\nWhy Are We Doing This (Again...)?\n-----------------------------------"
