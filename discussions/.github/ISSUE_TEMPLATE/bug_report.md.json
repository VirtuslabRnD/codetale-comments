When you start creating the issue and start typing description of the issue - you get \"x similar issues\" appear next to the \"create issue\" button. When you click it you will get ..... a list of similar issues... Maybe we should drag people's attention to this - it's rather natural (but I think Github Failed in making it visible enough). \r\n\r\n\r\n![Screenshot from 2020-04-21 16-56-43](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/595491/79881321-5387ff00-83f1-11ea-82ed-6a7d2d93811e.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n![Screenshot from 2020-04-21 17-00-13](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/595491/79881523-9944c780-83f1-11ea-8da2-778c8509f611.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Searching moves you out from what you wanted to do (i.e. create an issue). I think from the user experience the \"similar issues\" are much more natural than \"search first\" and \"create issue later\". Maybe we can suggest both ?",
