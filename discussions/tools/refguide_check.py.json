I just noticed that `lib.recfunctions` was previously absent, so refguide_check wasn't executing docstrings in that module, some of which were the subject of reviewer comments (probably diffs originated from before refguide switch when I was using vanilla doctests).\r\n\r\nAlso, even if I add `lib.recfunctions`, not all function docstrings therein are executed -- it seems I also need to add functions to `__all__` in the module, but I'm hesitant do start doing that more broadly without reviewer approval first. Thoughts on this?",

If they are not intended to be private then they should be added. That said, `lib.recfunctions` has always been an oddball, as it is not imported at the top level.\r\n\r\n@shoyer Not all functions in `lib.recfunctions` have dispatchers.",

So these properly don't have dispatchers -- there's no array argument on which to call a dispatcher method (we don't have duck-typed dtypes). Let me know if there's anything in particular that you think I missed, though...",
