Before the merger the code looked like this:\r\n```\r\n// Calls to this should probably be changed to expectThrows.\r\n// This was added as it was all over the place in the pre\r\n// JUnit code.\r\nobject ThrowsHelper {\r\n  def assertThrowsAnd[T <: Throwable, U](\r\n      expectedThrowable: Class[T],\r\n      code: => U)(cond: T => Boolean): Unit = {\r\n    val c = cond(expectThrows(expectedThrowable, code))\r\n    assert(c)\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n``` \r\nNow that you mention it, I am not sure what this comment really means - I assumed it wanted the calls to this object to be changed, but maybe it meant just the function name (as in `expectThrowsAnd`). Perhaps it should be removed either way for the ambiguity.",
