        "body" : "Good point. I've added a failing test-case and made the test runner a bit more sophisticated. It now checks that the expected set of tests succeeds or fails.\r\n\r\nThis also revealed a race-condition in the test-runner with the in-memory ledger. If a test-case failed then the flow was torn down causing the sandbox to be shut-down which caused other still running test-cases to fail.\r\n\r\nI've changed the test-runner so that the flow is not torn down on test-case failure, but instead all tests are run to completion. The final exit-code tells if any test-case failed.",
