        "body" : "So this ugly piece of code takes care when an execution context is wrapped via `ExecutionContext.fromExecutorService`, but it will not detect the problem if a different wrapper is used.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, you could try to submit something to the given execution context and look at the executing thread's name to see whether they belong to the same execution context. Unfortunately, as there is no standard on how execution contexts name their threads, that's probably as brittle as the current mechanism.\r\n\r\nSo maybe just add a comment here that this test is not fool-proof?",
