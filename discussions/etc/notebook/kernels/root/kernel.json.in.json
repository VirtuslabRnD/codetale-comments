For example, on macOS you may have Homebrew Python vs the system Python with the same version, and just `python2.7` or `python3.5` may still pick the wrong one (i.e. `/usr/bin/python2.7` instead of `/usr/local/bin/python2.7` from Homebrew).",

Like this, a Python installation other than the one in the `kernel.json` file can be used to run the kernel without rewriting manually the `kernel.json`. Of course, such other installation needs to be compatible with the one that ROOT was built against (also compiled with the same compiler).",
