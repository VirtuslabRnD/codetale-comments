        "body" : "Yes. It was not needed. \r\n\r\nIn fact if you want the full story - that was a bit of a hack to have non-empty parameter list. The problem is that in the version of bash that is popular (and used in Travis/Dockerhub) an empty bash ARRAY is treated as undefined variable (only in latest versions it is not). I prefer to keep `set -u` but it causes an empty array to fail when used. Therefore I added a flag \"-t\" originally that I knew was irrelevant (allocating terminal in this case does not change anything - colors work,  no user input needed). After adding \"-e\" the array was not empty and I could remove \"-t\"",
