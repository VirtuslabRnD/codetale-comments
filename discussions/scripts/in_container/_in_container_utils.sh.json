        "body" : "Not really. The problem is that there are no common parts between the \"in_container\" and \"out_container\" stuff. We are even excluding the non-in-container scripts when we prepare the images, to make sure that what we run outside of the container is not run inside (by default). I think it's important to keep that separation. This is a really small piece of code that does not really require maintenance - kind of a \"util\" class (and a nice one to have at that - since we already use traps in several places and traps - unfortunately - in shell scripts are simply replacing previous traps rather than add to them.",
