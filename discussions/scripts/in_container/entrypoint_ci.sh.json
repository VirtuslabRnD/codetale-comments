        "body" : "Because it takes much longer. That's the only reason. From observations, it takes usually 2-4 times longer to install an sdist package than .whl, And this test already runs for quite a few minutes, so I wanted to reduce the strain on CI\r\n\r\nDo you think @ashb we should? Do you expect any problems with sdist comparing to wheel? I can easily change it to install from sdist additionally to wheels, but it will make our tests quite a bit longer, so unless there is a good reason we suspect something wrong we should not do it. \r\n\r\nThe only reason I am installing sdist for providers is that the setup.py are generated there and they were wrong initially, but i was considering to drop that as well, as I do not expect any more problems there - sdist should behave same as .wh  if setup.py is there",
