It's possible that it works on your machine, partest tries to use git and some other tools to get the best diff it can, so depending on your environment you might get different results.\n\nIt seems that the one used for me and some other people doesn't get appended to the test transcript the way the reporting expects, that's why it didn't get printed. The fix is here: https://github.com/lampepfl/dotty/pull/612\n",
