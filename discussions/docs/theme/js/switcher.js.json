        "body" : "This change is about being able to version the two docs independently. The old script first looked for a version string in the path so if you were at `https://example.com/foo/1.0.0/bar/baz.html`, it knew to look for `https://example.com/foo/versions.json` and replace the `1.0.0` with the selected version. As a fallback it looked for `https://example.com/versions.json`\r\n\r\nThe trouble now is that now you may be at `https://docs.daml.com/daml-driver-for-postgres/foo/bar.html` and need to figure out that your \"root\" is actually `https://docs.daml.com/daml-driver-for-postgres/`. Our theme already sets the `DOCUMENTATION_OPTIONS.URL_ROOT` property which is the relative path to the root of the sphinx tree. Afaict it's always `./` or `../` repeated. I can't use `https://docs.daml.com/daml-driver-for-postgres/foo/../` as the root, as that leads to bugs when trying to match on `root/version`. Ie I end up trying to match `https://docs.daml.com/daml-driver-for-postgres/foo/../` with `https://docs.daml.com/daml-driver-for-postgres/` which fails so I decided to just count depth and \"navigate up\".",
