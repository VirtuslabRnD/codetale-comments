We can probably get pretty far on that for Kube users.\n\n> Another option is to just set the lead process to have this uid, but allow\n> other processes to have other virtual uids which map back to useless\n> physical uids.\n> \n> Another option, which I'm not sure if it works at all, is to map multiple\n> virtual uids to 1 physical uids.\n\nI don't think it works.  In docker upstream we had a long discussion on this about ranges - we _think_ we can allocate ranges and have this work, but you have to have large ranges.  If people had to predeclare how many uids they need and had a map or something, we could maybe allocate a set for a namespace (10k was mooted per container before).  I've also wondered whether we could just do two ranges - shared, and unshared.  Shared is allocated by the master and cluster wide.  Unshared is node scoped and each started container gets a set.  I _think_ you can then pass two ranges into the container.  @mrunalp to keep me honest here.\n\n> (I'm using virtual to mean \"in-namespace\" and physical to mean \"in the root\n> linux namespace\").\n> \n> Another option is to use a per-volume strategy for virtual-to-physical\n> mapping.\n> For NFS, you could use the NFS mount options to map a single local uid to a\n> true remote uid using anonuid and anongid.

So we can make single uid work well, and have multi uid be not quite as nice.  \n\n> ---\n> \n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\n> https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes/pull/3910/files#r23854292\n",

Security context as modeled is a bit more like volumes.  It means a finalizer goes and turns a generic intent (maybe expressed by the admin or the namespace) onto a specific context on the pod (pod should run as this UID).  Your suggesting the opposite, something that the user can set \"hey, I want this kind of security context\", and then something has to go finalize and specialize it.\n",

Those distinctions should be in this proposal and in service account (or whatever context it takes)\n\n> If so, do you think the current design allows those three groups to work\n> independently of each other and to focus on the information they need?  I'm\n> not sure; I'm trying to think that through.\n\nI think the proposal doesn't describe the higher level pieces that are in service account and secrets, but assumes they exist.  I would feel like service account is a concept for the developer end of the spectrum and security context is much more about the other end.  The cluster and project admins must allow developers to have capabilities, the developers must understand how they use those capabilities, and in general higher level developer concepts get boiled down into security contexts and execution details.  So this proposal is definitely talking about a part of the overall story.\n\nThe outcome of these proposals / prototypes should at minimum include a document that describes the above and how the pieces provide that spectrum.\n\nI _think_ at this point that I could argue a convincing story about:\n- how namespaces get a service account by default (configured by cluster admins)\n- project admins can tweak both those and authorization policies (what we are working through here https://github.com/openshift/origin/blob/master/docs/proposals/policy.md) to properly isolate those\n- some secrets get added by default or via developers directly adding them to service accounts or their pods\n- how service accounts are converted to a security context down to the kubelet via finalizers / admission controller\n- how secrets from a service account (or other mechanism) could be bind mounted into containers, either a la the docker vault / secrets proposals, or via a more specific volume type\n- how the kubelet could take the info on the security context and turn it into a user namespace / labels / volumes\n- how developers could adapt their images and applications to work within the limitations of the above items\n\nThere is of course a lot of handwaving in between those bits.\n",
