If there is a critical bugfix, a new release from master can be created ahead of schedule.\n* Kube X.Y.Z-beta.W: When master is feature-complete for Kube X.Y, we will cut the release-X.Y branch 2 weeks prior to the desired X.Y.0 date and cherrypick only PRs essential to X.Y.  This cut will be marked as X.Y.0-beta.0, and master will be revved to X.Y+1.0-alpha.0.  If we're not satisfied with X.Y.0-beta.0, we'll release other beta releases, (X.Y.0-beta.W | W > 0) as necessary.\n* Kube X.Y.0: Final release, cut from the release-X.Y branch cut two weeks prior.  X.Y.1-beta.0 will be tagged at the same commit on the same branch.  X.Y.0 occur 3 to 4 months after X.Y-1.0.\n* Kube X.Y.Z, Z > 0: [Patch releases](#patches) are released as we cherrypick commits into the release-X.Y branch, (which is at X.Y.Z-beta.W,) as needed.  X.Y.Z is cut straight from the release-X.Y branch, and X.Y.Z+1-beta.0 is tagged on the same commit.\n"
