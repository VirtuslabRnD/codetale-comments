For instance, `Endpoints` objects are created and updated by the endpoints controller, and nodes are discovered, managed, and monitored by the node controller. These could eventually be split into separate components to make them independently pluggable.\n\nThe [`replicationcontroller`](../replication-controller.md) is a mechanism that is layered on top of the simple [`pod`](../pods.md) API. We eventually plan to port it to a generic plug-in mechanism, once one is implemented.\n\n"
