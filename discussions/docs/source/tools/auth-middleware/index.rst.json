        "body" : "The `/auth` endpoint only looks for the cookie and returns whatever is stored in it. I.e. it can't return a refresh token if none is present in the cookie. So, all that the additional flag could do is make the request fail if a refresh token was requested but missing. In the current case it's up to the client to check if a refresh token was returned and decide whether to fail if it's missing or not. I don't have strong preference either way. The latter approach seems a bit simpler to me.",
