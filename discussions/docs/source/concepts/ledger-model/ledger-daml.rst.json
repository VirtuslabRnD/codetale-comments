This is the next thing that is awkward about this document as \"contract\" has several meanings throughout this document.\r\n\r\n1. The set of things about which we want to have a (contract) model.\r\n2. An instance of a template (on a ledger).\r\n3. Sometimes, loosely refers to the template defining it. In cases where 2. has not been made.\r\n\r\nI would make a lot more changes to these documents, but `git` is just the wrong tool for this. So, I wanted to limit this change to an independent, small-delta commit.",
