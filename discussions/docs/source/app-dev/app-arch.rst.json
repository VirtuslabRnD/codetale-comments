Since the in-memory sandbox shipped as part of the SDK is a full-fledged implementation of a DAML ledger, it's usually the tool of choice for these tests. Please note that this does not replace acceptance tests with the actual ledger implementation that your application aims to use in production. Whatever your choice is, sharing a single ledger to run several tests is a suggested best practice.\n\nShare the ledger\n****************\n"
