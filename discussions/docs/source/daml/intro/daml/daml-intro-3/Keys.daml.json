        "body" : "@bame-da I’ve removed all the other `Helper` templates but this one. We could in principle add a `queryContractKey` function to remove this as well but I’m not sure this is a good idea:\r\n\r\n1. For keys, it matters that you fetch within the same transaction since the contents associated with the key can change.\r\n2. We don’t use this anywhere else. I think it’s crucial to actually introduce `fetchByKey` so you have to introduce `fetchByKey` as well as `queryContractId` which just adds more stuff to learn.",
