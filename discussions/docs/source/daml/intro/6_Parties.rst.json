In this section you'll learn about  the formal authorization model to allow you to reason through your contract models. This will allow you to construct them in such a way that you don't run into authorization errors at runtime, or, worse still, allow malicious transactions.\n\nIn :ref:`choices` you learned that a transaction is, equivalently, a tree of transactions, or a forest of actions, where each transaction is a list of actions, and each action has a child-transaction called its consequences.\n\nEach action has a set of *required authorizers* -- the parties that must authorize that action -- and each transaction has a set of *authorizers* -- the parties that did actually authorize the transaction."
