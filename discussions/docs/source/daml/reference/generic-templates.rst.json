That’s only true in this example since you require it to be an instance of “Template”.\r\n2. Can my generic template be parametrized by multiple types? Afaik, the answer is “yes” but I’ve admittedly never tried that.\r\n\r\nTotally fine, to address that in separate PRs.",

The bank is able to create the coin proposal which Alice can then accept. This scenario results in two contract creations: first the proposal contract, which is consumed to give rise to the coin contract."
