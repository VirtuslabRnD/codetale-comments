I don't think it's fair to expect the reader to automatically understand the fact that we are using Semantic UI (we actually don't mention that anywhere) which translates into HTML, and we are selecting the resulting HTML elements. This was an actual issue for me when I was writing selectors, until I realised this point. I take your point that it's in the weeds, but it might still be helpful.",
