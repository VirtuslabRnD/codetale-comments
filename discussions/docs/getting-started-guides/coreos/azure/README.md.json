I could put the exact revision, but that's also impossible since revision is unknown until I commit it. I can see there are release branches, however the last one that exists is `release-0.10`, so it seems like a release branches had been deprecated. In fact, this guide is pointing user to the JavaScript code that is part of the guide itself and Go code is not compiled as part of this or anything like that. I am considering it to be safe to keep the user on master here, as I am not expecting anyone to touch this Azure provisioning code much at all.\n",
