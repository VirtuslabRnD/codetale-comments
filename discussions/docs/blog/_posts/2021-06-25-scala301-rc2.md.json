    "diffHunk" : "@@ -1,1 +7,11 @@---\n\nThis post is a quick announcement of Scala 3.0.1-RC2. This is the second release candidate for 3.0.1. The reason for this release is that a regression with respect to 3.0.0 was introduced by PR [#12519](https://github.com/lampepfl/dotty/pull/12519) which caused the compiler to fail where it shouldn't. We have fixed this regression in PR [#12827](https://github.com/lampepfl/dotty/pull/12827) and backported it to 3.0.1. This is the main reason for having 3.0.1-RC2 before 3.0.1 which is due in one week.\n\nBesides this main change, taking advantage of the fact that RC2 is happening, we have also included various SBT reporting improvements (PR [#12845](https://github.com/lampepfl/dotty/pull/12845)) which should improve interaction with [Metals](https://scalameta.org/metals/). Also we've backported a few infrastructural fixes even though they aren't a regression from 3.0.0."
