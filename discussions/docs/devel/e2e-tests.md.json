A test should only be added to CI after is has been running in some non-CI suite long enough to establish a track record showing that the test does not fail when run against *working* software.  Note also that tests running in CI are generally running on a well-loaded cluster, so must contend for resources; see above about [kinds of tests](#kinds_of_tests).\n\nGenerally, a feature starts as `experimental`, and will be run in some suite owned by the team developing the feature.  If a feature is in beta or GA, it *should* block the merge-queue.  In moving from experimental to beta or GA, tests that are expected to pass by default should simply remove the `[Feature:.+]` label, and will be incorporated into our core suites.  If tests are not expected to pass by default, (e.g. they require a special environment such as added quota,) they should remain with the `[Feature:.+]` label, and the suites that run them should be incorporated into the [munger config](https://github.com/kubernetes/contrib/blob/master/mungegithub/mungers/submit-queue.go) via the `jenkins-jobs` flag.\n\nOccasionally, we'll want to add tests to better exercise features that are already GA.  These tests also shouldn't go straight to CI.  They should begin by being marked as `[Flaky]` to be run outside of CI, and once a track-record for them is established, they may be promoted out of `[Flaky]`."
