For major/minor releases, there's an expectation that you'll create patch releases, so preemptively creating the release branch is reasonable. You actually don't have to - our tools could retroactively create the release branch.\n\nFor patch releases, the assumption is that they're terminal. A patch release should only be a tag. You can imagine creating hotfix branches off of patch releases, but this is a bit of a different conversation and not tied to the normal release process - these are probably tied to specific customers, e.g. \n1.0.1-acme etc. But at this point in the release process, we have nothing that would do that.\n\n(FWIW, I've been trying to stick to the nomenclature of \"patch release\" for .Z version bumps, because we currently have a version system that is http://semver.org/ compliant.)\n",
