These docs are generally in a bad state and we are moving them out of the docs repo to reduce maintenance overhead.  I am less concerned about the links breaking than I am about the staleness of the technical content (At least when the links break it is obvious what is broken). I am just porting over this change because it was made in the docs repo before after I moved it to this repo.\n",
