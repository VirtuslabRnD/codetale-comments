        "body" : "The issue I had with introducing the `Option[A]` `Semigroup` this early was there are some nuances to it with regards to how it handles `None`. Since the `Semigroup` instance is sort of incidental because it really is a `Monoid` instance, I opted to introduce it in the `Monoid` section instead.\n\n I could perhaps show an early `Map` example and say details to come later in this post. As I type that out I think that's a good idea, I'll go ahead and do that.\n",
