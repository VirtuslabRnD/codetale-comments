        "body" : "Maybe? Feature vs. enhancement could mean different things in terms of the scope of the projects, whether or not it is digging into existing code and making changes vs. adding a lot of new code. Or it could be the differentiator between \"goes in release notes and marketing things, or not.\" We could just assume for now that features and enhancements are all just enhancements, and if we find that we need further clarity in the future, figure it out later.\n\nI think it's useful to split out community-related processes, such as this one; they're not necessarily things that need to be in a roadmap or release notes. And may be useful to store in a separate place from roadmap / specs after approval / implementation, so folks can easily see how things evolved. But I'm not married to the idea by any means. :bride_with_veil: \n",
