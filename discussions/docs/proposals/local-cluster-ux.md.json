As a developer myself, being able to test against new versions of docker is helpful.\n\nOn the other hand, requiring the kubelet to run natively inside a docker container and support all its features is proving to be hard. It is the path that we have taken now and it is not easy. On top of that, docker now can run natively on OS X and Windows and this makes the UX much harder. \n",
