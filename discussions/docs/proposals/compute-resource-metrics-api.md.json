I almost wonder if we want separate api groups for each (e.g. `kubelet-metrics`, or maybe just `kubelet` or `node`). On the one hand, we want consistency so keeping them together makes sense, on the other hand it should be clear which is served by which component. Separate groups also prevents reuse of common types across the APIs. Another option would be to prefix kubelet-only types with \"kubelet\" (e.g. s/pods/kubeletPods/), but this could get messy if we decide to start serving them at the cluster level.\n\nThoughts?\n",

For stats we could probably tolerate data loss. For events, we might want to try harder to avoid it, such as by buffering on local disk.\n\nSimilarly, if we used longer history dependent on such a storage backend, we'd likely need to cache and/or eagerly pre-compute decisions made using the history in order to tolerate outages, and maybe even to cut circular dependencies. (Once we have horizontal and vertical auto-scaling, we'll want to use them for almost everything.)\n\nI view analytics and UI use cases as being somewhat separate from the online production usage scenarios.\n",
