Would enable file systems that are dynamically composed from multiple images. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uJlTllziPI\n2. Container volumes: Execute an image to populate a volume. Maybe could subsume (1). I want to use this approach rather than create more volume sources similar to gitRepo. I could imagine using it to pull from private git repos, GCS, S3, etc.\n\nIf we wanted to support in-place updates, and I'm not sure we do, behavior should be identical to updates for downward API, configmap, and secret volumes. If attached to a volume, we could support atomic data updates.\n\nIf a container populating an emptyDir fails, it can be retried, by flushing the contents of the dir and creating a new one. That's more complicated with init containers, which presumably wouldn't be required to have a 1-to-1 relationship between container and volume.\n\nThis factoring also makes it more straightforward in the API to add an initialization container to a pod together with its corresponding volume.\n\nThat's not to say that I think init containers have no utility, but for the purpose of initializing volumes, they impair the system's ability to manage the process.\n",

Some of the implementation details of volume containers are more complex than init containers, so strictly speaking it is probably easier to start with init containers\n5. People already approximate volume containers today in app containers, so an init container is strictly better than app containers for decoupling app decisions.\n\n?

If I need to insert the binary in my container, I might as well invoke it in an entrypoint script. How much value does it add? \n\nInstead of stacking init containers at the pod level, we could just attach them to the specific container they're initializaing and call them PreStart container hooks. This feels less useful in a pod context, I'd want to wait till all containers in my pod are initialized before starting any part of the app.\n",
