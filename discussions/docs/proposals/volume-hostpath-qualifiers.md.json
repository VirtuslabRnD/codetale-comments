        "body" : "Within a pod, it's the responsibility of those two processes to synchronize on the socket themselves.\n\nThe root problem, of some random directory being created if the socket doesn't exist, doesn't happen in that instance because the containers presumably don't implement docker's logic of \"exists || mkdir\", and it's well understood that the emptyDir exists as a directory with nothing in it.\n\nintrapod is also less challenging because it isn't implicitly relying on some external state/process existing.\n",
