Or an ObjectReference to a Node in v1beta1?\n\nThe Kind must be interpreted in the context of a specific group and version.\n\nNow, in the example above, the obviously right thing to do would be to convert the ObjectReference to the API version requested by the client -- which we don't do right now, AFAICT -- we convert the schema of ObjectReference, but not its contents. selfLink has a similar problem.\n\nSuch conversion is made harder by groups because we don't have a way for the client to specify which API version is expected for each group. (That would be ugly, anyway.)\n\nFor now, I'd convert cross-group references to the default (storage) version for each group, but I'll think about this more. Pinning to specific versions in other groups has the significant disadvantage that it wouldn't work well for APIs evolving at different rates, since that would be as if they were all in the same monolithic group.\n",

We plan to take the latter approach and place such types in a new package called `unversioned`, because many of the common top-level objects, such as APIVersions, VersionList, and APIResourceList, which are used in the API discovery, and pkg/api#Status, are part of the protocol between client and server, and do not belong to the domain-specific parts of the API, which will evolve independently over time.\n\n    Types in the unversioned package will not have the APIVersion field, but may retain the Kind field.\n\n    For backward compatibility, when hanlding the Status, the server will encode it to v1 if the client expects the Status to be encoded in v1, otherwise the server will send the unversioned#Status. If an error occurs before the version can be determined, the server will send the unversioned#Status."
