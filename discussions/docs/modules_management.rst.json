        "body" : "I think it would be worth to add section about .pth files (https://docs.python.org/3/library/site.html#module-site) . I often find it invaluable (especially in production installation) to modularize access to different parts of code. Big organisations often have a lot of independent modules and components and often they are not installed by \"pip\" packages (for various reason - compilation needs, necessity to use code from sources etc.)  and in those cases adding paths to search in .pth files is a really nice way of modularising such access. Then you need to just drop the .pth file in one of the site modules. The .pth has also the nice property that it can have an executable that it executed at every python interpreter start. It is also used in big packages that needs to be installed from sources (example ROS uses .pth files extensively http://wiki.ros.org/rospy)",
