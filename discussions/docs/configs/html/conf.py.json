See line 173 which has almost what you need here except for the file ending. One option would be to just move the file ending to the call site or alternatively duplicate `github-asset` and come up with a somewhat sensible name.",

We want the file ending to be part of the URL, and we can't have the release string at the call site, and we only get one argument for the URL.\r\n\r\nThis parses the entire quoted string as the artifact name within the URL:\r\n\r\n```\r\n:gihtub-asset:`link text <asset-name>.zip`\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis does not substitute `{}`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n:gihtub-asset:`link text <asset-name-{}.zip>`\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis does not substitute `|release|`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n:gihtub-asset:`link text <asset-name-|release|.zip>`\r\n```\r\n\r\nI was not very happy about the time it took me to realize `rst_prolog` existed and was the only way to achieve this, but now that I have, I must say I'm not quite sure what is wrong with it.",

We could still have `github-asset-zip` and `github-asset-exe`.\r\n\r\nAs for `rst_prolog`. I don’t care too much if we use `extlinks` or `rst_prolog` but I’d like this to be consistent. Using one for the Windows installer and the other for protobuf tarballs is pretty confusing.",
