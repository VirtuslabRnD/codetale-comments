Keep in mind that the optimal configs for one app may not apply to one with a different topology or input topic.\n            In addition to the recommended configs above, you may want to consider using partitioned index filters as described by the <a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/wiki/Partitioned-Index-Filters\">RocksDB docs</a>\n\n          </dl>"
