In the future, for each entry, edit the topics and edit the explanations can be separated in git history because they are in different lines. I notice we changed the terms used to describe the topics before, and this kind of changes may happen in the future again. Change the terms used to describe the topics often doesn't affect the sentences following them. This is why I think separate them to different lines is good.\r\n2. These new line breaks won't show up when the markdown files are rendered to htmls. Since it won't affect the reading of the docs, I think add them looks ok.",
