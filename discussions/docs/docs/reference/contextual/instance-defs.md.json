E.g., assuming a global method `currentThreadPool` returning a value with a member `context`, one could define:\n```scala\nimplied ctx for ExecutionContext = currentThreadPool().context\n```\nThis creates an implied instance `ctx` of type `ExecutionContext` that resolves to the right hand side `currentThreadPool().context`. Each time an implied instance of `ExecutionContext` is demanded, the result of evaluating the right-hand side expression is returned."
