Our Ansible style guide also doesn't cover this, but documenting modules has an example section:\r\nhttps://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/dev_guide/developing_modules_documenting.html#examples-block\r\n\r\nThat uses an initial cap. Also the few examples I poked at in https://github.com/ansible/ansible-examples also uses initial cap for names.  I'll ask @acozine directly if she wants to adopt this as a standard (and say so in the docs so it's clear).\r\n",
