The only relevant guidelines I saw are the OASIS standards and the guidelines for other similar projects that are referenced from here: https://github.com/oasis-roles/meta_standards#references .\r\nI believe such notes about idiomatic use do not really belong to the present document, which only specifies what is allowed and how things work and is not very prescriptive.",
