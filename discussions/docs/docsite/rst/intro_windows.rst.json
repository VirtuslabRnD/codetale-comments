As the usefulness declines, we should go back and revise/edit as needed instead of writing for a future point in time. In my experience, I've found that customers skim docs more than read them, and things in \"( )\" are often skimmed right over/ignored. ",

A new ticket is created in a temporary credential cache for each host, before each task executes (to minimize the chance of ticket expiration). The temporary credential caches are deleted after each task, and will not interfere with the default credential cache.\n\nTo disable automatic ticket management (e.g., to use an existing SSO ticket or call ``kinit`` manually to populate the default credential cache), set ``ansible_winrm_kinit_mode=manual`` via inventory."
