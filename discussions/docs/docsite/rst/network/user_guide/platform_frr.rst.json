I thought the purpose of column Q in John's internal spreadsheet (update platform guides) was specifically to have them use collections. \r\n\r\nAlso, what you are changing here is the 2.10 FRR platform guide. You would need to backport this to 2.9 to have it applicable/available for 2.9.  \r\n\r\nBut this brings up a bigger issue. All of the 2.9 platform guides are... for 2.9 :-)  None of them have details about collections, yet  the 1.0.0 collections will all point to these guides. \r\n\r\nSo for now, just keep it as you have it (no FQCN) and backport please.\r\nI'll discuss more openly what we should do to cover the fact that the batch of 1.0.0 network collections will work with 2.9 and what if anything we should put in 2.9 platform docs.",
