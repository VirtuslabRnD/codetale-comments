User specified no ansible_network_os. \r\nThis will still trigger the auto-detection and the outcome will be the same, either the auto detection is successful and the correct network_os is used, or the auto-detection fails and default is uses\r\n2. User specified ansible_network_os = default\r\nPreviously this would trigger the auto-detection (despite the user wanting to use the default network_os) which would fail and default would be used. After the change, the result will be the same, (but auto-detection will not have been tried).\r\n\r\nI think the only scenario that could cause an issue is if someone was specifying ansible_network_os=default in order to trigger auto-detection (which I don't believe was documented anywhere)",
