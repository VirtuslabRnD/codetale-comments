Something like, \"Installing the SSL certificate of your vCenter or ESXi server on your Ansible control node ensures that all communication between the two systems is secure\" or \"supports encryption of all files transferred by Ansible to your server\". Or start the section with \"All vCenter and ESXi servers require SSL encryption on all SSH connections to enforce secure communication. If you see the following warning while using Ansible VMware modules [warning], you need to enable SSL encryption for Ansible by installing the server's SSL certificates on your Ansible control node.\"",
