        "body" : "only 5 weeks between first pre-release and the release? IMHO, that is too little. I would personally like to see prerelease on pypi appearing at least 2 months before the release.\r\n\r\nIf there is a feature freeze, why there is no package published for it?\r\n\r\nBased on my experience very few people are testing pre-releases and even fewer are testing code from devel branch.\r\n\r\nFor several Ansible related projects I do have CI/CD pipelines which test prereleases of dependencies, which allow us to find breakages. Still for this to function we need to make the pre-release publishing something common, I would argue that as common as patch-releases on stable branches.\r\n",
