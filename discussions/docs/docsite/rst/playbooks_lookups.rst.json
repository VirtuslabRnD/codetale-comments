I think ```<lookup``` is meant to be placeholder meaning substitute your variable here.  So perhaps ``` ``with_<lookup>`` ``` (although that may conflict with rst syntax.

Starting with Ansible version 2.5, lookups are used more explicitly as part of Jinja2 expressions fed into the ``loop`` keyword.\n\n"
