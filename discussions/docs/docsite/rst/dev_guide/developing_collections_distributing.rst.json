Just wondering if someon would search 'how do I distribute my collection' vs 'how do I publish my collection' ? I also don't see anything in official AH documentation or marketing details that calls it a distribution server?",

I made sure the first paragraph includes both terms. Looking at it again, though, I see that I don't mention packaging it up to create the tarball . . . I'll add a sentence about that.",
