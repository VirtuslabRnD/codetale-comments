I also don't see anything in official AH documentation or marketing details that calls it a distribution server?",

I made sure the first paragraph includes both terms. Looking at it again, though, I see that I don't mention packaging it up to create the tarball . . . I'll add a sentence about that.",

If we truly believe that no one should use the `--token` feature we should remove it from the code base.

I don't mind adding some more info here about security, but I imagine this is like every other tool out there where tokens are used on the command line.",
