This has\r\n    several reasons:\r\n    * Versions may not always be floats, for instance \"2.1.0\" or \"2.0alpha1\".\r\n    * Versions may not compare correctly if used as a float.  A float will tempt\r\n       naive comparison between 2.3 and 2.12 which won't generate the correct\r\n       ordering.  Strings \"2.3\" and \"2.12\" require a bit of code which will let the\r\n       programmer do it correctly.",
