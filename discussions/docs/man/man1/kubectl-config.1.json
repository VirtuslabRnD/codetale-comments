The flag may only be set once and no merging takes place.\n2. If $KUBECONFIG environment variable is set, then it is used a list of paths (normal path delimitting rules for your system).  These paths are merged together.  When a value is modified, it is modified in the file that defines the stanza.  When a value is created, it is created in the first file that exists.  If no files in the chain exist, then it creates the last file in the list.\n3. Otherwise, ${HOME}/.kube/config is used and no merging takes place."
