I feel that it will take everyone who's interested in trying Dotty through multiple hoops. I'd like it to just be \"google dotty, find webpage, minimal sbt config, run dotty\". Instead of \"google dotty, find webpage, find link to example project, read most of README to know which options to use, set up sbt config, run dotty\".\r\n\r\nMaybe we should restructure the intro page and put this information at the top after the logo and show a condensed version of the dotty example project README which we also refer to for more information.",
