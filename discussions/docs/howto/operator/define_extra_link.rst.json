        "body" : "@milton0825 It makes sense, but only all the information about the operators would be in one place. This is not true in this case. I will suggest a different structure because I am concerned that the number of guides on the use of operators will grow rapidly. In this case, the guides about creating a new operator can be easily overlooked when it is just a small sub-point in large list.\r\n\r\nI would like these fragment in a new page that will contain information on the creation of operators.  As a part of SOD 2009, I proposed the project \"4. How to create a workflow\" and one of its expected deliverables is to create such a page.\r\n> A page for developing custom operators that includes:\r\n> * Describing mechanisms that are important when creating an operator, such as > template fields, UI color, hooks, connection, etc.\r\n> * Describing the responsibility between the operator and the hook\r\n> * Considerations for dealing with shared resources (such as connections and hooks)\r\n\r\nhttps://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Season+of+Docs+2019\r\n\r\nAs mentors of SOD project, I set a personal goal to improve the structure of the documentation.  I agree that the recommendations will be useful and I will try to develop them.\r\n\r\nI hope my explanations were helpful.",
