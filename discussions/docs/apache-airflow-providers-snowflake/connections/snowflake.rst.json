I am assuming users using the Airflow UI would see that some of these have their own field and understand what's going on. Maybe it would be best to add a note about this somewhere in the documentation?",

        "body" : "Agree with @sunkickr. This documentation is mostly for those who want to define the connnections manually rather than via UI. When you configure the connection via UI you have dedicated fields, but when you create it manually via cli or env variable, those need to be extras (the UI remaps values to extras). I think it's best to leave it as it is - users of Airlfow know how it works, and even if not, the UI fields for those \"custom\" connections have enough description/are clear enough. And in case you have those custom fields, extra is not even visible in the UI, so it is pretty clear what's going on I think.",
