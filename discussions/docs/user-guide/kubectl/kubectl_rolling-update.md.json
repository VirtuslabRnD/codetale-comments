I thought the point of this PR was to allow rolling-updates of the \"same\" (e.g. non-distinct) image so long as `--image-pull-policy=always` (as noted below). Should it instead read \"Must be distinct from the existing image (either new image or new image tag) unless the `--image-pull-policy=always` argument is passed.\"\n",
