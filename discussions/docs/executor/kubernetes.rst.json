I really love things like mermaid - that can generate the image from markdown-ish text description and have everyone contribute to it easily. Maybe we can re-create the graphs with it . See  #10380 - mermaid has the capability of generating nice diagrams from the textual description which I think is crucial to get images that we can update in the future as a community effort.",
