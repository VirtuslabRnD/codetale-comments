It also allows the time duration to be easily changed in one place. None of the these tests should take more than a few hundred milliseconds so I think 5 seconds is plenty of time to wait.",

        "body" : "@eatkins Thank you for the review & suggestion. The PR got better as a result.\r\n\r\nI implemented the shorter timeout and a common, central routine.\r\n\r\n I kept the new routine within the ProcessSuite object, rather than your suggested ProcessOs, \r\nbecause I think the block or suspend is more closely logically related to the test being\r\nsuspended rather than the underlying process.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know, if possible, if this adequately resolves your concern.  Thank you.\r\n",
