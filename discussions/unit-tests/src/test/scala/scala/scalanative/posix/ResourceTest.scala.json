        "body" : "Wojciech,  thank you for the review.\r\n\r\nI can move the tests to wherever you direct, but I think the current location\r\nis the proper place for two reasons:\r\n\r\n1) The Test as-is, as explained in the comment, does not exercise the\r\n     potentially problematic methods.  It should be as safe as any other\r\n     Test currently in the `unit-tests` project.  \r\n\r\n     Being in the same place as the other posixlib tests makes it \r\n     easy to find.   Granted that is a concern only after the Test is\r\n     shown to be and is considered safe.\r\n\r\n     The two problematic methods _could_ be tested  using a \r\n      `scripted` test.  The time/benefit ratio of requiring such a test,\r\n      is not advantageous, especially when there has been discussion\r\n      about removing/limiting `scripted` tests.  \r\n\r\n2)  From reverse engineering the contents of `tests-ext`, it looks like\r\n     the purpose of that project is to support parts of Scala Native\r\n     outside the core.  `posixlib sys/resource.scala` should be part of\r\n     the core of Scala Native, at least until some OS dependent spinoffs\r\n     are designed and implemented.  \r\n\r\nPlease advise.",
