If there's an `ansible-doc` already on the path, the generated \"new plugins\" metadata will be incorrect (based on whatever version it is, likely empty in most cases). If they don't have one, it'll just fail when it tries to run it.\r\n\r\nThe only way to actually detect it that I can think of (and still not 100% bulletproof, but pretty good) would be to parse the version from `ansible-doc --version` and ensure that it matches what's being requested.",
