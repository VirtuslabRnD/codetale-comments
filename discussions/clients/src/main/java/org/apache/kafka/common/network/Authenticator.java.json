Given this fact, it might be best to provide a default empty implementation and then only implement it in `SaslServerAuthenticator`.  It would make the PR diff smaller, too (no need to implement in `SaslClientAuthenticator`, `PlaintextChannelBuilder.PlaintextAuthenticator`, and `SslChannelBuilder.SslAuthenticator`).",
