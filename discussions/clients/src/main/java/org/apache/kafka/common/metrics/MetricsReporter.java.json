However, `JmxReporter.contextChange(...)` seems to assume that `contextChange(...)` will be called before any metrics are added via `init(...)`.\r\n\r\nIf that call pattern is true, then I think we should document it. If it's also true it can be called later, then mention this as well. For example, the JavaDoc text on `contextChange(...)` could be something like:\r\n\r\n> Sets the context labels for the service or library that is exposing metrics. \r\n> This will be called before {@link #init(List)} and may be called anytime after that.\r\n\r\nWDYT?",
