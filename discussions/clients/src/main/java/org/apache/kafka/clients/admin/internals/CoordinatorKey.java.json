But I'll take this discussion to the email thread/the PR I'll open shortly.",

It seems that we could unwrap it depending on the context and only expose what the user need (e.g. group id).\r\n\r\nPersonally, I believe that we should strive for keeping all the constructors of `*Result` classes package private for the time being until KIP-692 is accepted, if it will.",

I was mistaken here - we can just keep the original method signature and convert the internal `CoordinatorKey` mapping to the `String` group id. Apologies for the confusion, the way that @mimaison has it here works just fine, I'll use a similar approach when implementing KIP-709.",
