        "body" : "why do we need to `synchronized` a private method?\r\n\r\nI was just looking into `trunk` and it seems to be `synchronized` there, too. Also, some methods are `synchronized` others are not, but I could not see any pattern. Should we just `synchronized` all public method? Performance should not be a concern for `MockProducer`. On the other hand, when would a producer be used by multiple threads? Neither `KafkaConsumer` nor `KafkaProducer` are thread-safe by design. Why does `MockProducer` need to be thread-safe?",

Because all public methods within `MockProducer` call `verifyState()` it makes sense what findbugs complains about. Did miss this connection before. So maybe drop latest commit :) \r\n\r\nSorry for the forth and back.",
