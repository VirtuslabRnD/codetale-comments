I could add a separate boolean to check if we've run once, but don't want to overcomplicate it if not needed. I'm not sure why there is a risk of hanging?\r\n\r\nWe always hit runnable.call. Assuming it doesn't hang itself (which we can't do anything about, short of spinning up another thread), it will do one of:\r\n\r\n1. Return successfully, in which case the whole function returns.\r\n2. Throws an Exception, in which case we test if the timeout has expired and a) rethrow if it has or b) sleep and retest if it has not.\r\n3. Throws an Assertion error, in which case we handled it the same way as 2.\r\n4. Throws an Error, in which case the we also unwind the stack, just without rethrowing.\r\n\r\nLet me know if I missed a case. Thanks!\r\n",
