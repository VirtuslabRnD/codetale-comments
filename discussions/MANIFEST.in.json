I'm thinking of the sdist more as an archive of the tagged source tree (the first purpose in https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0517/#terminology-and-goals). We also package `benchmarks`, `docs` and `tools`, and I don't see a very strong reason to just leave out these files. \r\n\r\nEDIT: I'll move this to a separate comment to not lose it if we revise.",
