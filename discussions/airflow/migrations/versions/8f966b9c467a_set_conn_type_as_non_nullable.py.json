The user will receive information on the specific migration, so user will be able to easily determine the source of the problem. I do not want to modify this table because the user may have had different assumptions based on this field. Airflow has always required this field not to be null. Only various hacks of the user could lead to this state, so he will best know the solution to this problem.",
