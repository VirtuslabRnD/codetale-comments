I thought about confirmation and explicit info for the user that the operation ended with success. \r\nLike I mentioned in previous comment. \r\nBut when I am looking at debug info today it make sense to log response. The question is if the DebugExecutor logs this  in the console, I supposed it is logged. Anyway, debug is ok for me.  ",
