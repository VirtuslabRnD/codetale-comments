        "body" : "The previous version was incorrect in a few cases. This can be simplified if you look at the fact that some of the requirements are included in others, but the current version makes it easier to understand the relationship between tasks. I note that in Airflow we define requirements and Airflow can automatically detect redundancy and optimize it. If there is something the computer can do, the computer should do it.\r\n\r\nI'm worried about task `transform_file`, which has no upstream dependencies, so so this task can be executed before the bucket is created.\r\n",
