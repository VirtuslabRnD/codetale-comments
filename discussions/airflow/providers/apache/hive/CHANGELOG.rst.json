Since it costs us nothing but it improves the documentation which is released as part of the providers - yes I thought about it yesterday and while I initially excluded them, I think it is definitely worth to release it. It is important to get the updated user documentation in the hands of the users I believe. \r\n\r\nIt has zero risk, practically no consequences for our users (they will just install newer version when they do). It costs us almost nothing for the batch release. \r\n\r\nYes. I truly believe it is worth to release them.",
