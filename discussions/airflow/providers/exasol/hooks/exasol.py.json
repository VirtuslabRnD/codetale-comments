Please refer to https://github.com/badoo/pyexasol/blob/master/pyexasol/connection.py#L259 \r\n\r\nI don't know Exasol well, but based on the implementation here, this new method supports whatever the original method in `Pyexasol` supports. So to my understanding, the question you raised should not be a concern.\r\n\r\nLet me know if this makes sense to you?",

Here is the exasol info:\r\n\r\n\r\n>The target file can either be CSV or FBV files and should comply to the format specifications in the CSV Data Format and the Fixblock Data format (FBV). File names may only consist of ASCII characters. A BOMClosed is not supported.\r\n\r\nhttps://docs.exasol.com/sql/export.htm#UsageNotes\r\n\r\nSupporting formats not supported by exasol is something that we may consider adding using pandas (read_csv -> df -> save_as_format). However, I'm not sure if this is something that should happen in Airflow task. The data can be arbitrary big so keeping it in memory may be problematic.",
