        "body" : "No, new connections should be set up using \"project\", \"key_path\", etc. fields that are displayed in the Airflow UI, not extras. I think \"extras\" is opaque for users who haven't read the code. However, if someone uses a connection that predates this change and DOES have an \"extra\" field, the code [here](https://github.com/airbnb/airflow/pull/1119/files#diff-a9d313c95097c265b6b934953bdfb2dbR78) will recognize that and handle it properly.\n\nAs far as I know, the connection type is largely irrelevant to Airflow -- you could create an \"FTP\" connection and pass it to `GCSHook`, and as long as it had the correct attributes it would work properly. The only thing that the type does affect is the fields that are displayed/handled by the UI (which are put in the \"extras\" field anyway behind the scenes)\n\nSo bottom line, lets say you have a connection of type `google_cloud_storage` with `key_path` in extras, and you've been using it with `GoogleCloudStorageHook`, you should be able to pass that same connection to a `GCSHook` no problem.\n",
