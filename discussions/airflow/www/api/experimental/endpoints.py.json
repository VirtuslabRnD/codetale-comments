For the API it is probably more sensible to default to un-trucated time, but this would be potentially \"breaking\" change, so we need to think about how we upgrade existing users.\r\n\r\nFor the 1.10 release series I would probably suggest that the default shouldn't change, just in case someone is relying on it.\r\n\r\nIf you could do this as two PRs (both against master) the first adding the behavour we talked about, but not changing the deafult behaviour (which we can get in to the next 1.10.x release, I will cherry-pick the merged PR back to the relase branch) and then once that is merged a second one that changes the default to be as you describe.\r\n\r\nHow does that sound?",
