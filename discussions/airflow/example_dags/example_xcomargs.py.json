One other issue is that if we do this at this line:\r\n```\r\nxcom_args_a >> bash_op1 >>  xcom_args_b\r\n```\r\n\r\nIs this supposed to work? i have not tried yet, but looking at the code, I think `BaseOperator.__rshift__` will complain that it can't handle `xcom_args`. That's a different issue though so the fix can be done separately.",

I think that once we have your PR merged we may consider something like `TaskType` that will be union of types that are \"task-like\"",
