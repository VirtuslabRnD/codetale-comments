For example, it might make more sense to keep framework state in a local db (or as is more common amongst mesos frameworks, in zookeeper), instead of in-memory. Further, that will also be useful when we move towards HA for airflow scheduler (say https://github.com/airbnb/airflow/issues/392 ). May be we can open an issue and take this up sometime later.\n",
