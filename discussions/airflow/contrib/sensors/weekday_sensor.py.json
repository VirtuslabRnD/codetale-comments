In that case, I would change the argument to `now`, with a value of `True` indicating that the now time should be used (and the default being False).",

        "body" : "The idea behind that having current date as default (`use_task_execution_day`=`False`) - most of the use-cases for any of these sensors are to stop until a certain day. For e.g. for weekdaysensor - the users want to run the DAG on weekends when everyone is on holiday. \r\n\r\nAlso, all of our current sensors use current date (as compared to execution_date) - but like you I wanted an option to use execution_date as well as Airflow model is certainly built around execution dates, hence I added this functionality to at least this 2 sensors for now.
