An SQLAchemy exception is basically the only thing that could pop out of that `session.add`, and filtering by error message doesn't seem relevant to me.\r\n\r\nAlso, logging CLI actions is non-critical. If it fails for any other reason than \"table log doesn't exist\" like failing to connect to the database or SQLAlchemy is badly installed or whatever, we mostly don't care.\r\n\r\nThe only thing that this PR changes is that instead of a huge wall of red text we get a few lines of blue text in the terminal when `session.add(log)` fails. As it was before, it wasn't stopping the CLI action to move forward.",
