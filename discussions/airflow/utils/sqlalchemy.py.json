        "body" : "This is debatable. Without FK enabled, for SQLite, the migration script `2e82aab8ef20_rename_user_table.py` doesn't change the FK of `chart` and `known_event` tables, they would continue to point to `user` table which no longer exists. Alembic then fails with `NoSuchTableError`.\r\n\r\nDrawback is that existing SQLite DBs are not fixed. My assumtion is that SQLite is not used in production environment and doesn't contain long-living data. If that assumption is wrong I can add an additional migration script that checks and fixes the wrong FK for SQLite.",
