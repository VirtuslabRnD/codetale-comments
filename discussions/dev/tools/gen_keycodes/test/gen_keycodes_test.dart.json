        "body" : "I agree, they're not very comprehensive. They are supposed to be smoke tests to make sure that we're generating at least a minimum of the output for each of the platforms without the test being too fragile.\r\n\r\nI added them because some symbols I was depending on have disappeared/changed names in the past, and because we didn't have any tests at all for the keygen script. Just having a test file makes it more likely that tests will get written, even if it were just \"exit(0)\".",
