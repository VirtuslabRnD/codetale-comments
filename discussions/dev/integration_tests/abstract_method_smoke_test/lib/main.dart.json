        "body" : "This wasn't causing the WAKE_LOCK--it's just that the test depends on the keyboard being shown, and the test is also being run by a fuzzer that randomly taps on the screen. This test was never working on some subset of devices and it took a long time for us to realize because the fuzzer would consistently tap on this text field and bring up the keyboard at some random point during the test. I want to remove it because it's not related to the test case at all in the first place, it's just potentially confusing.\r\n\r\nThe WAKE_LOCK remains to be solved. I just wanted to get some obvious issues out of the way first.",
