        "body" : "Thanks! yes this is a very good test.\r\n\r\nI think the current situation is worse (which happened a few times)\r\n- If there is a change on the framework, engine tests won't run and won't break. \r\n- developer will merge the change to flutter/flutter\r\n- engine developers will start seeing failure on random PRs for felt firefox step (since it's the first step that runs integration tests)\r\n- Later (after a research probably) the flutter/flutter PR will be reverted\r\n- PR author will try to test the PR running felt locally, this is also a little tricky since there are many flutter/flutter developers who does not normally do engine development\r\n\r\nIn the new process,\r\n- flutter/flutter developers would be protected against the changes to e2e and also against platform channels and text editing changes\r\n- flutter/engine developers, will break the the tests on the engine side first if they are making a change that would change the communication between flutter and the web engine (so the tree will be read)\r\n- If the change is on purpose, then there should be a handshake (there should be 3 PRs in a row, first one would change the test or the code to a temporary state. Last one will fix it.)\r\n\r\nI think this is good since this is also reminds both engine/flutter PRs about the other repo. If this was a package (rather than the engine itself) best could have been to use a version in the pubspec of course. But I think we have this problem for many issues between engine<->flutter repo.\r\n\r\nThanks for the reminder though I'm chat with @Hixie to see what can we do for this type of changes. May be we can add a guide for developers.",
