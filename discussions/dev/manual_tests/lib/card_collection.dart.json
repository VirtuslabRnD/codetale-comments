It does mean that the behavior has changed, but the old behavior was wrong.\r\n\r\nIf they are overflowing their container now, then they can either turn on \"isDense\" in the InputDecoration, or give the text field a InputDecoration.collapsed decoration.\r\n\r\nThe height of the text field can't be a constant, unfortunately.  If it's multi-line or the textScaleFactor is >1.0, or the child of the decorator isn't a text field at all, then it'll be wrong.",
