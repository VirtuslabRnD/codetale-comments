        "body" : "No, I tried that, but if I make the constructor const, then on the line where the contents are const, it wants a const constructor to be used:\r\n```dart\r\ncomponents.add(const _ComponentTuple('code', <String>[]));\r\n```\r\nBut then at runtime it throws because I'm modifying the contents of an unmodifiable list. It works if I leave off the const, but the analyzer complains then. So, since I can't use the const anyhow, I decided to not make the tuple be const.",
