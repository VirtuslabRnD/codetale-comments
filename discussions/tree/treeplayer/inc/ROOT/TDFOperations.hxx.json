Would it not matter, since we seem to always refer to operations with their fully qualified name?\r\n\r\nJust a bit of brain-storming on the naming: operations are, in fact, helpers of `TDataFrameAction`. They encapsulate the logic of each action. They are the de facto action executors (but the term executor is already used elsewhere). We could go as far as moving the `Operations` classes inside the `TDataFrameAction` class scope: they are not supposed to be used elsewhere.\r\n\r\nI don't see an obviously better choice. What do you think? @dpiparo ?",
