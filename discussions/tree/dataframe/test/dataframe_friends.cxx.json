It is just best to add (in particular in a 'test' :) ) those kind of tests (when practical and easy).   [again this is not 'important' enough (as it just will 'just'/'only' make debugging problem easier for the few rare-ish cases i mentioned) to warrant a PR for this particular test but it is worth getting in the habit of doing (and yes, many, too many, of the existing tests are not up to notch in that regards)]",
