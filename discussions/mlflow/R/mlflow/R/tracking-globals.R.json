        "body" : "My personal preference is to prefix absolutely everything, we've done that in packages like `sparklyr` (as in `spark_`, `ml_`, etc), `tensorflow` (as in `tf_`, etc), and more recently `torch` (as in `torch_`, etc.). The reasoning, not having a prefix in R packages is expensive... Once you define something outside of a package, you need to figure out how that might potentially interact with other packages.\r\n\r\nFor instance, for `log_metric`, we might have to consider how that interacts with other model logging methods from the R community. So far, I don't think there are any package clashes, but one day this could change. Would be nice for instance if one could `log_metric` without using mlflow, then connect mlflow, and the code won't break.\r\n\r\nSo net-net, I would encourage we keep prefixes in most functions, unless we feel strongly a function is meant to be top-level and deserves the extra work of potentially interfacing with other packages.",
