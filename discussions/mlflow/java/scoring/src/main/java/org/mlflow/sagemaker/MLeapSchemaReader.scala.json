        "body" : "Unfortunately, Jackson's ObjectMapper in Java doesn't work well with Scala case classes, this is why MLeapSchemaReader is written in Scala, using Spray Json. \r\n\r\nI've added support for doing this in MLeap itself in this commit https://github.com/combust/mleap/pull/496/commits/9725d2cc5dabc542daf08b00f988ded458efb0f2 so once that's merged and a new version of MLeap becomes available, I'll raise another PR to remove the scala plugin from mlflow. What do you think?\r\n",
