        "body" : "`mlflow artifacts download` requires the `run_id` and seems to be part of a set of [CLI commands](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/eb51e79d190afb8d0dd5f987cd4be00b4dd744d2/mlflow/store/cli.py#L90) that also require `run_id`. I assumed those were meant to be used within the context of a tracking server. \r\n\r\n`data.download` is what we'd like to use ideally, and it'd make sense for it to do basically what `_download_artifacts_from_uri` does. @andrewmchen was looking at this but we didn't want to block on it for the runs:/ URI work as it may not make it into 1.0. (It's not completely straight-forward because there is a small difference between its behavior and that of `_download_artifacts_from_uri` (in appending the basename to the destination path), and we need to make sure projects don't break after the change).\r\n\r\nin summary, to use either of those would require behavior changes for them, so i'd vote for not blocking on that and using the new CLI command, and marking the new command as experimental so we can swap it out as soon as we can with hopefully `mlflow download`.
