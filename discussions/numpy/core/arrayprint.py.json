I just tried replacing `data = ravel(asarray(a))` with `data = a`, but running the command:\n\n```\npython3 runtests.py -t numpy/core/tests/test_multiarray.py:TestBinop\n```\n\ncauses an infinite loop throwing up a max recursion depth error.  \n\nIn fact, an infinite loop also happens if you call `asanyarray(a)`, and since `ravel` now calls `asanyarray` instead of `asarray`, I had to add `asarray` here.\n",

And `numpy/core/tests/test_multiarray.py:TestBinop` is the only test that fails with `ravel(a)`.  I figured that instead of changing the test, I should change `ravel(a)` to `ravel(asarray(a))` since then the `_array2string` function would have the same exact effect as before this PR (`ravel` used to call `asarray` anyway).\n",
