This code has successfully compiled using regular Visual Studio and Visual C++ for Python 2.7 (both of which were done on Windows 2012 R2 and my local Windows 8.1).\r\n\r\nIt makes no sense because I can't find anything in my code that could possibly affect umath_tests.c, and it's not like the npymath library is affecting this :(",
