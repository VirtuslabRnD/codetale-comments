This changes that `a[['a']]` is not made a scalar either (so the test in its current form doesn't test the change). This is all because apparently a string is an ellipsis, but a sequence of strings isn't ;). But I think this is right, postprocessing field access seems weird to me. Unless you argue that it is a behaviour change in a minor release, even if the behaviour doesn't make sense.\n",
