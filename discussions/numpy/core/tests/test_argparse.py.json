Confuses me as well, the best idea I have is that the inclusion/compilation both with `_multiarray_tests` and with `_multiarray_umath` confuses the coverage (it no seems to report no coverage at all)?  Which would mean that `mem_overlap` coverage should also be off, and that sounds a bit familiar.",
