I was accounting for the worst case scenario. Max ULP measured for exp was 2.52 which means a rounding of nearest could push the ULP difference to 3. ",

I think I would like if you add the comment that you posted here on top of the file(s). It is not like one can easily guess what the hex values are, or whether they are denormals.\r\n\r\nMy thinking was along the following lines: the file `umath-validation-set-log` would contain all the values we would want to test log function across all dtypes. So, in the future if we wanted to add tests for np.float16, then we could  just add those values in this file with the corresponding ULP error and wouldn't need to edit the `test_umath_accuracy.py` file.  But yes, a README or comments is surely warranted. I will add that. ",
