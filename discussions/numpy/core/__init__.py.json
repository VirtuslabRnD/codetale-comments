It does _not_ do `import mod`. In most cases, doing `from mod import ...` will not put `mod` into the namespace.\n\nRight, I know that :-). But I was misreading the bug report -- I\nthought the claim was that \"from numeric import *\" was failing because\n\"numeric\" had not yet been imported. In fact, like you say,\nnumpy/core/**init**.py is assuming that 'numeric' will appear in its\nnamespace when numeric gets imported. Which is confusing. Certainly it\nconfused me :-).\n\n> it gets inserted into the package's namespace, as long as no one is doing anything slightly weird. We wouldn't have to change any other instance of `from mod import ...` outside of `__init__.py` files.\n\nYes, if that's the actual problem. See below.\n\n> But sometimes slightly weird things do happen. Code analysis tools will often want to import modules directly and thus miss some details like making sure that when executing the `__init__.py` code, it should be as a package and not just another module. Now it's fair to say that those tools should be fixed to be more robust, however, I think that it's also fair to explicitly import the names that we need instead of relying on a quirk of CPython's import implementation. I don't even know if it's documented well anywhere. It might not work exactly the same way on other implementations.\n\nThe semantics of Python namespaces are pretty well nailed down; we\nmight well want to add explicit imports to make it less confusing, but\nI wouldn't say that it's undocumented that the package and **init**\nshare a namespace.\n\nFurthermore, it doesn't look like there's any hooking of the import\nmechanism going on. AFAICT from the traceback, the sequence of events\nis:\n\n\"pymacs.py\" is a script that runs as a daemon for emacs to talk to.\nEmacs starts up pymacs.py.\n\nEmacs asks pymacs.py to do something like\neval(\"pyeval_load_helper('ropemacs', ...)\")\n\npyeval_load_helper calls **import**(\"ropemacs\"). Note that this is the\nstandard builtin **import** function, and AFAICT there are no import\nhooks registered.\n\nThen ropemacs imports difflib, and difflib does \"from collections\nimport namedtuple\". But, a sys.path screwup causes this to be hijacked\nby another \"collections.py\" module in the working dir (maybe\nmatplotlib.collections? who knows). This interloper module then\nimports numpy. So I suspect ropemacs has nothing to do with this -- it\nhasn't made it past line 4 of ropemacs.**init** before the error\noccurs. And even if numpy imported correctly, the code would still\ncrash, because this \"collections.py\" probably doesn't export\nnamedtuple.\n\nOTOH, I tried doing eval(\"**import**('numpy')\") in python 2.7, and it\nworked fine. So I don't know why it doesn't work when pymacs calls\n**import**.\n\nI don't have any objection to adding import calls to make numpy's code\nmore explicit, but this seems to be a bug in either the Python\ninterpreter or perhaps pymacs, and should probably be filed\nappropriately.\n",
