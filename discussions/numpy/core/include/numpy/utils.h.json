        "body" : "The BSD thread was about warnings issued by clang, the compiler they are replacing gcc with, so I put it in for portability. I don't know if we are compiling with clang on Apple yet. The warning problem seems to be compiler dependent, even up to compiler micro version, and it was inconclusive if it was a compiler bug or not, or even specified by the C standards. I suspect we will need to deal with this on a case by case basis. It would be nice if we could figure out a MSVC version just for completeness. @zooba Any ideas? ",
