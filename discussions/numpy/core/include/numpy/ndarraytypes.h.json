That should not break anyone's code unless we start moving the internals around, at which point folks will probably need to recompile as the functions are inline, i.e., the accesses to struct internals will still be there. So we can guarantee API but not ABI. That is already the case for PyArrayObject, but I don't know if that is widely publicised. It may be that we need to make that a policy, because otherwise we are frozen.\n",

        "body" : "I hope no-one is embedding this struct into a larger one, b/c that's going\nto be broken no matter what. I guess they might be able to get away with it\nATM because dtypes don't actually support GC traversal, but this is a bug\n-- dtypes can participate in reference loops! (for example\ndtype->subarray->base is a pointer to a dtype). And any type supporting GC\n_must_ have all instances allocated via PyObject_GC_New, b/c this allocates\nsome extra memory at a known offset where the GC will scribble bookkeeping\ninformation during its traversal. If you try to stick a GC-supporting type\ninto another struct or something anything like that, then the GC will end\nup scribbling on random memory.\n\nSo I'm not too worried about breaking code that does that. It'll be broken\nsooner or later regardless.\n\nAnd I concur that the cython thing is just an annoyance. Probably we should\nask them to get rid of it.\n\nI don't recall any reports of brokenness after the 1.7 release, which was\nthe last time we increased the size of dtype instances.\n\nWe should talk more about dtype rejiggering but probably this is not the\nright thread for that discussion :-)\n\nOn Thu, Dec 4, 2014 at 2:36 PM, Julian Taylor notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\n> In numpy/core/include/numpy/ndarraytypes.h:\n> \n> > @@ -619,6 +620,10 @@ typedef struct _PyArray_Descr {\n> >           \\* for NumPy 1.7.0.\n> >           */\n> >          NpyAuxData *c_metadata;\n> > -        /\\* Cached hash value (-1 if not yet computed).\n> > -         \\* This was added for NumPy 2.0.0.\n> > -         */\n> > -        npy_hash_t hash;\n> \n> I haven't finished my ufunc patch yet, though it goes along the lines that\n> njsmith suggested, keep the current structure and internally use a larger\n> one.
