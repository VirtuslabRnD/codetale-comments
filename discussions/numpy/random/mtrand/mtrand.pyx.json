        "body" : "(1) Yes, unfortunately numpy doesn't have an in-place swap function, so the temp buffer is used to accomplish that. The array is still modified in place -- two lines down the buffer gets written back to it. (2) And yes, this only shuffles items in the outer array, which is what the function is documented to do. I'd have thought shuffling along an axis made more sense, but the API was made 5+ years ago so...\n",
