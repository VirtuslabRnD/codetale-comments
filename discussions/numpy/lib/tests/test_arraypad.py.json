        "body" : "In the changed regions, the mean of 5 and 6 was calculated thanks to `stat_length=2`. In IEEE correct rounding (NumPy standard), 5.5 should round to 6, however, in the prior function the calculations were carried out and immediately _cast_ into the original dtype (akin to `arr.astype(np.int32)`). The casting operation truncates like `np.floor` instead of rounding properly, resulting in systematic error in the rounded regions. It's pure luck that more didn't need to be changed; the block of 4s on the left is rounded down from 4.5 in the IEEE standard, thus truncation is equivalent there.\n\nI believe this is the correct way to do it, but if truncating/direct casting was _desired_ for some reason the previous version could be considered correct in its own way.\n",
