If either of you are interested in starting a project we can bring it under the akka organization (perhaps `akka/alpakka-google-auth`) and setup a release for it.\r\n\r\nRealistically this is probably something the akka team will get to soon, but I'm willing to help facilitate the integration/library/release/etc.",
