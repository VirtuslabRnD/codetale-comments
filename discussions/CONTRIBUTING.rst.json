(we can wait with that until I merge some simplifications and optimisations to make it quite a bit lighter). \r\n\r\nBreeze has stabilised a lot and it is being used by more people now so I think that might be good time to make it the \"default\" dev environment.\r\n\r\nWe have `./breeze --build-docs` command that runs the build in automatically downloaded/updated docker container so no matter what  OS you run it all it will yield the same results (note that it is written in the way that it will generate the output files in host (the volumes are mounted from host during build). And you do not need the doc server in fact as you can simply open the index.html locally and it will work the same (except search maybe).\r\n\r\nSome more context: I have plans to remove all the locally run scripts from the documentation and leave breeze as the default way of doing most development tasks. I am going to remove most of the docs referring to the scripts and leave breeze docs only.\r\n\r\nWDYT @dstandish ? We can add this comment now, but maybe going 'breeze-first' should be the next step ?",
