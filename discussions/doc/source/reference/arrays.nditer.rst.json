It uses the term \"view\" in a possbily misleading way, since the writeback arrays are not actually views, they are temp buffers.\r\n\r\nHere's my try going through it:\r\n```\r\n By default, the :class:`nditer` treats the input operand as a read-only\r\n object. To be able to modify the array elements, you must specify either\r\n read-write or write-only mode using the `'readwrite'` or `'writeonly'`\r\n per-operand flags. \r\n\r\n The nditer will then yield writeable buffer arrays which you may modify. However,\r\n because  the nditer must copy this buffer data back to the original array once\r\n iteration is finished, you must signal when the iteration is ended, by one of two \r\n methods. You may either:\r\n\r\n - used the nditer as a context manager using the `with` statement, and \r\n   the temporary data will be written back when the context is exited.\r\n - call the iterator's `close` method once finished iterating, which will trigger\r\n   the write-back.\r\n\r\n The nditer can no longer be iterated once either `close` is called or its\r\n context is exited.\r\n\r\n When assigning to the buffers returned by the nditer, also remember that you must \r\n perform the assignment using the ellipsis index, as in `x[...] = `, rather than \r\n simply reassigning the variable name as in `x = `.\r\n[Note: Consider deleting this last paragaph entirely?]\r\n```",
