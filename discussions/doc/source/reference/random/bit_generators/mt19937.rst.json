There are use cases where someone wants to consuma a bit generator but doesn't want anything else (.e.g writing their own low-level Generator-like objects).  Should they be directed to numpy.random.__init__. Also, there are a lot of intentionally private parts to random, so I think there was some consideration about what should and shouldn't be private here (or what should be stable and what is not). ",

You can't just add many new submodules to the numpy API without any proposal or discussion. My understanding was that all public functions and classes were added to the `numpy.random` namespace. Hence my question in the summary of this PR about the few functions that are missing there - were they intended to be public or not?\r\n\r\n> Should they be directed to `numpy.random.__init__`. \r\n\r\nI don't see a problem with that. `np.random.MT19937` is clearer than `np.random.mt19937.MT19937`.",
