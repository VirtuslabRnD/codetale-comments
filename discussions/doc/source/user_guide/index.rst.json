        "body" : "I 100% agree, but it makes more sense to me to work on those in separate PRs after the whole restructure. There is already another PR for a top level \"Getting started\" section, that probably should be the linked for the \"Users brand-new...\" comment.\r\n\r\nI think moving all the pages and finding an agreement on all the structures will actually take quite a lot of time, and will require a decent amount of discussion. That's why I'm proposing smaller PRs, to be able to keep some progress. Also, I think that will let us see the progress at every step, and make us move in the right direction (kind of agile methodology).\r\n\r\nI mentioned it somewhere, but it was already work on trying to migrate all the documentation in a one-shot (see https://pandas-dev.github.io/pandas-sphinx-theme/pr-datapythonista_base/). After all the work on that, I think the approach will fail. If anyone else thinks a single PR or bigger PRs are better, I'm more than happy to leave this for someone else.",
