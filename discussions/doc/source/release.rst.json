Though Phillip Cloud asked me to do something that looks exact the opposite (initially my detailed explanation was located within the test doc string):\n\n\"add documentation to doc/release.rst, preferentially move the docstring in your test to release notes, but not necessary. if you just want to add a blurb that's fine too.\"\n\nAnyway, I'll try to make my explanation shorter, and put a one-liner in release.rst.\n",
