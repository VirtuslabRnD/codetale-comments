Shortly after they will be added as io.js collaborators by people familiar with the onboarding process at io.js.\n\n#### Node should not automatically change rlimits\n\n* **Bradley**: summary is in node v0.10. Node respected soft ulimit for fds. Soft limit is recommended limit, second one called hard limit which is an enforced limit. By default, OSX has a very low soft limit, and that’s the reason why this patch landed. However when running programs, they usually don’t change rlimits, and we started seeing failures after the patch landed. Argument for the side for keeping the patch, you don’t hear people complaining about being out of file descriptors."
