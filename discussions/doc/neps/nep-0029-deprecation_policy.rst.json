It seems to me as though there are *two* situations that create discrepancies: a release shortly after a minor version drops out of support, or shortly after a new minor version enters.  In either case, the project will support a different subsets of Python.  Subsequent releases of those packages will fix it up, but I think the word \"guaranteed\" below is then too strong a statement.  We cannot guarantee when packages release, so if they take a long time to release after a new version of Python is introduced we're in trouble anyway.",
