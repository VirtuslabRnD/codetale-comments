The more I thought about it the more I realized it might not make sense to automate the git stuff since you also need to fetch the remote and rebase with whitespace fix... and figured it might be better to not do any of the git stuff and keep it as a separate task",

What I meant was to have the bash script print those commands to stdout, but let the maintainer type them themself â€“ the way `git node land` does when instructing to push to upstream is a pretty great UX IMHO.",
