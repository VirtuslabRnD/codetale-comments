        "body" : "I found [this section in the documentation](https://nodejs.org/api/n-api.html#n_api_working_with_javascript_properties) that provides some blanket statements for all of the methods for working with properties. Specifically, see:\r\n\r\n> JavaScript value: these are represented in N-API by napi_value. This can be a napi_value representing a String, Number or Symbol.\r\n\r\nGiven that, and the surrounding documentation, I'd prefer to keep this as is in this PR. However, I think the n-api documentation as a whole should be made more consistent with the rest of the Node docs. For example, I think each method should document that `key` can be a number, string, or symbol. That way, users don't have to read the entire page/section/whatever to get that information.",
