To my thinking, either you are posix complete (where that is another discussion altogether) or you are not.  Those three are defined in posix, why make someone hare off to clib?  Perhaps there could be defined\r\nhere as a call to the required clib version rather than duplicating code?\r\n\r\nAt the very least, I think this is worth a spin-off issue, to be corrected in detail and not hold up the overall PR.",
