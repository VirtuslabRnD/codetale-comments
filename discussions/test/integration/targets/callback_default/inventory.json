I can leave it on my to do list to shorten it, but at length of roughly 65s to run the test, it's not exactly long.\r\n\r\nI can probably leave them as is, but cut the task list to just 1, instead of 3 tasks.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that each one needs to be long enough to not be affected by jitter in the strategy, but each one needs to be 3*itself<next to avoid overlaps that make it not deterministic.\r\n\r\nSo 0.5*3==1.5 but due to jitter we need to ensure there is wiggle room between itself and the next host.",
