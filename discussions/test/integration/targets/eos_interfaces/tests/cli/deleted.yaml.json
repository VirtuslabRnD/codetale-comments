These tests should pass on any image as long as it has Ethernet1 and Ethernet2 available (and, ideally, using any other set of arbitrary non-management interfaces). Asserting commands is bad enough when we can't guarantee order (well, we can, but it really shouldn't be necessary), and making the check a one-way difference seems like it isn't really testing anything about what the commands are returning.\r\n\r\nOther modules should not have this problem, but l2 and l3 will be similarly hamstrung.",
