Is that good ?\r\n\r\nAgain, it's not super important as a practical matter for running the tests, however, I think this would be a good example to set.\r\n\r\nEven though you can reset a setting back to its default via the API, it doesn't really make the most sense for the modules, because as you start doing something, it could already have an existing non-default value. Saving the prior value and then re-setting it to that value is the best behavior.",
