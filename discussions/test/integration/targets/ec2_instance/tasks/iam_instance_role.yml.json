I've looked at the ec2 boto methods, and there is none that checks the existence of an instance_profile",

Possible solution would be to make a customer waiter for iam_role, in that case (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/blob/devel/lib/ansible/module_utils/aws/waiters.py) but this looks good to me as it is.~ <- err, ignore that. That won't work if IAM can access it but ec2 can't. ec2_instance could maybe use a customer waiter but ¯\\_ツ_/¯. LGTM.",
