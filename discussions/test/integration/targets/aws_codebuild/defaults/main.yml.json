This feels like we're just abusing IAM permissions that were granted for something else.\r\n2. splitting off the ID at the end feels like something which should be refactored for the other places IAM roles are used.\r\n\r\nAll in, might it be worth ansible-test offering some form of \"short_resource_prefix\" which doesn't include the hostname of the host running the tests, such that the length is fixed?  Then using `{{ short_resource_prefix }}-codebuild-service-role`",

        "body" : "1) I agree. I never meant for that role to be used for anything other than sts_assume_role tests. A follow up PR would be good when someone has time for that. In addition to these, the ec2_instance tests need it removed.\r\n2) Sure, maybe. There are a couple tests that do what I've done already (not necessarily for IAM role names) so it would be convenient for those. Different AWS services have different lengths and shippable doesn't have a problem running the full length name for these specific tests, but locally I cannot as my computer name is too long.",
