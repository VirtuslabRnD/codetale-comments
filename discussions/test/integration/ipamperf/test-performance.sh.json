        "body" : "The reason I exposed this is because the current arguments today are interpreted as a mix of golang args and test specific args passed down the code. Wanted to retain the ease of use and management of these details in the runner.\r\n\r\nIf we moved to direct args, then I feel it would be better to go test -c and then run the binary with the args directly. But I don't feel we need to make that change just yet.\r\n\r\nBut it did remind me that I have not updated the README for the custom test configuration, did that and pushed the new changes as part of this PR.",
