        "body" : "Well, it is not entirely true since not all of the absolute POSIX/Linux paths need to be prefixed with `file://` (https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/34765#issuecomment-674096790). I understand that this message is only shown to the Windows users but the message itself doesn't specify that it *only* involves Windows OS and may, therefore, lead to misunderstandings. Though we can just ignore that and tell people to just always prefix absolute paths. \r\nOtherwise, we can tweak the message to say `Absolute paths for Windows are not valid URLs without a file:// prefix.` though it feels \"strange\" to say `paths for Windows`.",

        "body" : "OK, so let's definitely mention Windows. I agree \"for Windows\" is a little awkward. Maybe one of these?:\r\n\r\n> On Windows, absolute paths must be prefixed with file://.\r\n\r\n> On Windows, paths that begin with drive letters must be prefixed with file://.\r\n\r\n> On Windows, absolute paths must be valid file::// URLs.\r\n\r\n> On Windows, absolute paths are not valid URLs without a file:// prefix.\r\n\r\n(I can live with that last one, but it's my least favorite because I'm not certain that absolute paths are not valid URLs. I mean c://a/b/c is not \"valid\" unless c: is the schema, I think? I could be wrong about that. And even if I'm right, it could be overly-pedantic of me. So I'm OK with it if it's the only version that will get consensus.)",
