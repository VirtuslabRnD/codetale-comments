And the change you propose me doing is not related to the bugfix at all.\r\n\r\nThen, about unit tests, the fact that I changed the name of the function and unit tests passed means that there are either no tests or they were not run. In anyway, it doesn't get tested on regular basis. So, it has much more TODOs which must be done, but definitely not as part of this change, IMHO.",
