        "body" : "I thought `linux2` was a python thing and was misspelled. Are there any linuxes where `process.platform` is set to `linux2`? From the conversation in the mailing list where the patch that introduced the test was [discussed](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/nodejs-dev/rxZ_RoH1Gn0), it seems that the problem was that in using `stat` on a file in the `/proc` directory caused issues and `readFileSync` should not use any `stat` call in its implementation. Then, looking the `stat` manual found this:\n\n> For most files under the /proc directory, stat() does not return the file size in the st_size field; instead the field is returned with the value 0.\n\nSo if there are `linux2` systems out there I think it would probably make sense testing in both `linux` and `linux2`. If someone could shed some light on this, it would be great.\n",
