        "body" : "I'm happy to have learned the `await once` pattern. Thanks! I'm going to leave it as-is because we can't use it with the `exit` event here in a simple way. It results in the program not exiting if we change it to `await` where it is because the event doesn't happen until the `disconnect()` call after all the promises resolve. So it's a deadlock. We could do the \"listening\" event that way, but then we have one using `await once` and one using callbacks, right next to each other, which seems odd to me. ",
