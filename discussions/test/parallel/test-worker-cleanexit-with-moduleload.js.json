        "body" : "@Trott - that is a very interesting question.\r\n\r\nIf the host has slow network (which I believe the `common.platformTimeout` controls), it should not affect the timing according to me, as the workers are doing some CPU bound stuff.\r\n\r\nIf we lower the timeout value, we run the risk of workers not yet entered into the space we want those to.\r\nIf we raise the timeout value, we run the risk of workers already exited the space we want those to.\r\n\r\nClearly what we want is most of the workers in the thick of module loading activities.\r\n\r\nIn short, though the current value may not be the best, it serves the purpose of leaving the workers at different program stages, and if that varies based on platforms, that is what we desire - in expectation of getting more variations.\r\n\r\nthoughts?\r\n",
