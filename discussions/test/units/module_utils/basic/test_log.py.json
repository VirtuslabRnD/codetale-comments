If the calls to syslog/journal that are presently in that file go through this method, then I think it would be fine to monkey patch them out.  We probably should break those tests out and put them in this subdirectory, though, so that people that look at it later know that log() is being tested in this file rather than simply omitted in test_basic.py.\n",
