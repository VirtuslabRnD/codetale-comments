However, this means byte strings can round trip through yaml on Python3 but\r\n            # not on Python2.  To make this code work the same on Python2 and Python3 (we want\r\n            # the Python3 behaviour) we need to change the methods in Ansible to:\r\n            # (1) Let byte strings pass through yaml without being converted on Python2\r\n            # (2) Convert byte strings to text strings before being given to pyyaml  (Without this,\r\n            #       strings would end up as byte strings most of the time which would mostly be wrong)\r\n            # In practice, we mostly read bytes in from files and then pass that to pyyaml, for which\r\n            # the present behavior is correct.\r\n            # This is a workaround for the current behavior.\r\n```",
