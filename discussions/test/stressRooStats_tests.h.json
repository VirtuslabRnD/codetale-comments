        "body" : "There is no in general a better minimum. The differences are simply due to numerical errors, which make the convergence of the two minimiser slightly different. The level is much smaller than 0.1, that tolerance is on the RooStats results which can be different due to different toys. A small difference in the minimizer results could create different toys and then a more different result. ",
