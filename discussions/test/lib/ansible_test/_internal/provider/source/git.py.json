        "body" : "@webknjaz I don't believe anyone has said it's dangerous.  It's discouraged.... the Python idiom is \"consenting adults\" meaning, use the single underscore convention to tell people not to use something rather than trying to outright stop them.  The double underscore isn't really an attempt for private methods and variables (the automatic rename is just another convention to be followed  if you really need access, for instance), it's meant to prevent conflicts between methods in things like helper methods for mixin classes (ie: you have a mixin that's generic and could be used with other classes that you don't control.  Using double underscore there makes it so the other class doesn't accidentally overwrite the mixin's private methods.)\r\n\r\nI would say that our style probably should be to use single underscores to denote private methods and attributes but I would not go so far as to say that double leading underscores are \"dangerous\".",
