CParser could be considered an implementation detail that changes but until we have a changed library, I wouldn't be sure if we'd want to feature test for CParser or do something else (For instance, the internal API could change so that CParser still exists but how it gets used changes.)  So it's probably premature to try to anticipate that.",
