There is an ongoing conversation - which I need to push forward more - about if and how we can add these lanes to the k8s ci.\r\nI have few internal jenkins instances inside RH on which we continuously run the tests. Another option is somehow hooking these instances to k8s prow, but it's challenging as well.\r\n\r\nThe problem is to get any device supported by device plugins, sriov happens to be the easiest for me to get access to but I'm very open to use any other device we can use.\r\nThe only requirement is to be a real device, no fakes/mocks (maybe we can re-evaluate this requirement?)",
