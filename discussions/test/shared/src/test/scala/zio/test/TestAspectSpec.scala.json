        "body" : "These tests are a little awkward to write because we would really like to use the `MockClock` here but we don't want to be using ZIO Test to test ZIO Test. I would shorten the timeout durations because we are using real time here and I don't think the actual amount of time matters since the effects will never terminate. You could probably just use 1 nanosecond here and 1 and 2 nanoseconds below.",
