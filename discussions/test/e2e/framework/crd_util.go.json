The function just does this ```strconv.Itoa(r.Int() % 10000)```\r\nI'm guessing yes, because it is still definitely an improvement to the flake rate. I guess I'm just wondering why framework doesn't have a way to generate suffixes that won't ever collide.",

However I would argue that it is the right thing to use randomSuffix() is a utility from the framework meant to solve this problem. The correct thing to do is to use it and we should probably file a bug to fix this. I do not believe this PR is the right place to fix that bug.",
