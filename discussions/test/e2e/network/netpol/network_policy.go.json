Maybe even shoot for tabular form.\r\n\r\nE.g., can this be reduced to:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    it: \"should support a 'default-deny-all' policy [Feature:NetworkPolicy]\",\r\n    name: \"deny-all-tcp-allow-dns\",\r\n    podSelector: select(),\r\n    egress: egress(ports(port(53, \"UDP\")), policyTypes(\"Ingress\", \"Egress\"), Peers()),\r\n    expectReachable: ...\r\n    expectUnreachable: ...\r\n}, {\r\n   // more\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can use all sorts of clever variadic functions and funtions that return `func(*NetworkPolicySpec)` to make a \"DSL\" of sorts that retains type-safety and brevity and makes it super-easy to see what is important in this testcase.  As you loop over the table you re-assemble the policy you want.\r\n\r\nThe reductivist test",

To me, that makes it harder to read / write new tests if you need to learn or modify some new NP declaration framework rather than using the raw API structs themselves, with the added benefit of it being more obvious exactly what the NP under test is.\r\n\r\nMaybe some sort of compromise? \r\n\r\n```\r\n// Returns a NP with the name / namespace, the rest unset.\r\nfunc newBasicPolicy(name, namespace string) NetworkPolicy {}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nthen\r\n\r\n```\r\nnpUnderTest = newBasicPolicy(name, ns)\r\nnpUnderTest.Spec.Selector = . . .\r\nnpUnderTest.Spec.Ingress = . . .\r\nnpUnderTest.Spec.Egress = . . .\r\n```\r\n\r\nAt least then you are dealing directly with the structs, but hiding most of the boilerplate within a helper function?
