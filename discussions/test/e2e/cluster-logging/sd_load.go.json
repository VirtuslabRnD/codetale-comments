From the manual runs that's more than enough, but I don't know of any guarantees/SLOs here (docs say log entries should appear [\"right away\"](https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/export/using_exported_logs#availability_2). I suggest leaving this as it is and then applying a fix if that's not enough, though I think timing out would indicate a problem with fluentd not being performant enough, rather than test being too restrictive on time.",
