You are responsible for creating this Service.\"\r\n\r\nIt seems that I am able to have a statefulset that works without a service but I still have to specify a \"serviceName\" in the statefulset. Without this it wont pass validation. But also the stateful set seems to work just fine without the service that the \"serviceName\" refers to. I'm open to having or not having the service, my worry would be that since the service is \"technically required\" it might break this test on a future version of Kubernetes when they decide to be more strict about it.",
