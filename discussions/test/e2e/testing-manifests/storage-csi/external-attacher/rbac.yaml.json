It wouldn't be hard to add support for loading the data via http(s), but do we want that (tests self-contained vs. depending on a growing number of external services), and how much do we trust https:/raw.githubusercontent.com to give us the right content?\r\n\r\nIt's probably okay, I just wanted to raise awareness about that aspect.\r\n\r\n",
