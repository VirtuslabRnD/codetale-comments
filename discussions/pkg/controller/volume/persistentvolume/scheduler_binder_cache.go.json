        "body" : "For now, a `bindingInfo` stores a pvc and a pv, to represent a binding relationship. So, in what way you want to expand it? Maybe add a field of bool, to indicate if the pvc needs provisioning? Or treat a pvc in a bindingInfo to be in need of provisioning if its pv not specified?\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if it a good idea to put all of the things in the binding data. I think the binding and provisioning are two independent phases, it would be clearer to store and process their data separately. In fact I even considered to rename  `PodBindingCache` to reflect the fact that the cache stores data of both bindings and provisionings, but not limited to binding info.",
