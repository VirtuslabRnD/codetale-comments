        "body" : "The problem is that we actually need to read data from etcd to get the Port for a given Kubelet, as it's no longer 'static' (in a sense that each Kubelet may be able to choose it's own port to run on), while we have a single 'KubeletClient' in master. We'll need to remove Port from it eventually, but it needs to stay there for backward compatibility.\n",
