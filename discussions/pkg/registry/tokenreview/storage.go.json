        "body" : "@kubernetes/kube-iam I was torn about this.  We have an unknown number of token authenticators that are included in the Authentication chain.  I could plumb through a set of union token authentications down through the masterconfig that are required to operate the same way as the authentication chain or I could create a fake request that only has a bearer token and count on the existing chain to do the right thing.\n\nI chose to make the fake request, figuring it was easier to get right.  My only concern is about whether some authenticator does weird things with requests it doesn't recognize.\n",
