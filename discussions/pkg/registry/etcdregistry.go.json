        "body" : "I spun on that a bit - maybe we want EtcdHelper to actually be the only interface we need (as you're suggesting).  In which case you use an EtcdHelper when you want to do higher level datastore operations on top of etcd, and to that end it's _better_ to not be able to call directly into a raw client.  Also, EtcdHelper can potentially do more to normalize errors (so instead of returning etcd.ItemAlreadyExists, return apiserver.ItemAlreadyExists) in which case this becomes much closer to resource/etcd than tools/etcdhelper.\n",
