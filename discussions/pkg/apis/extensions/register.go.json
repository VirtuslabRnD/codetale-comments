Users will still be able to access extensions/v1beta1/networkpolicy and networking.k8s.io/v1/networkpolicy. And the object can be stored in both versions in the etcd, according to user's choice.",

We do exactly the same trick with autoscaling and apps (unfortunately still conversely, i.e. internal types are in extensions; we should change that).\r\n\r\nAbout your question: yes we need the internal types being registered under extensions if the external types should work for that group. We never switch to another internal group during conversion. Technically, the types coming out of such a conversion will be the internal types from the networking group.",
