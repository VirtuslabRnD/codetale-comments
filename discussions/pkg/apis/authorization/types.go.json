I think that the latter is way more useful.  \n\nThe only hiccup I see is that some authentication methods provide group memberships as part of the Request, via headers, and other authentication methods provide a means to look up group membership.   I think the solution could be for group-providing authentication methods to cause a map[User][]Groups to be updated, and then for SubjectAccessReviews to query that map.\n",
