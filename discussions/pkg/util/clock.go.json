So I think the default expectation people would have is that Sleep would _block_ until the test advances the clock far enough (you could implement it via After).\n\nI guess I don't mind this too much but you should explain in a comment.\n",

But: maybe the tests shouldn't be advancing the clock manually, and instead, sleeping the way normal non test scenarios do...\n\nI actually wrote this so tests don't need to couple their impl to the clock mocking scheme ..... But maybe I'm not thinking of all the scenarios\n",
