However, I don't foresee this as being an issue unless someone is attaching/detaching millions of unique PDs (over the course of a a kubelet lifetime, which I'd guess is about a month for machine due to reboots required for patching), at which point they are likely to run in to GCE quota issues first.\n",

File an issue or at least document the known-leaking behavior in comments?\n",
