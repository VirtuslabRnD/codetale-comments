The implication of 307 is http transformation, but I'm wondering whether in many cases I may want to be redirected to something like a dns name, a tcp endpoint, a tcp endpoint with a port, or even possibly a key in a global store (to stretch the case as much as possible).  In introducing this, do we want to limit it to only things that can be URLs, only things that can be HTTP (which for services, we really have no idea whether they're http), or simply an opaque value that clients are required to understand?\n",
