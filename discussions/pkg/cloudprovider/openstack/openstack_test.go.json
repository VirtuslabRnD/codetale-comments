Since I wasn't looking forward to that and I wanted to verify my understanding of gophercloud anyway, I just added this and tested against a handy real OpenStack cluster.\n\nI added a short comment explaining that, but I know I'm still relying on the fact that OpenStack users will already recognise these variables and know what to do.  If you want more explanation for k8s/non-openstackers stumbling across this, let me know.\n",
