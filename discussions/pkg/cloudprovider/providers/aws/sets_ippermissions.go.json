        "body" : "It wasn't - we can't currently autogenerate things that can't be map-keys.  We had the same thing in #21907 for sets of net.IPNet.  There we ended up putting it into pkg/util/net/sets, expected alias for the import being netsets, with a readme that we will likely move it to pkg/util/sets when/if we get autogen to work.  And the API for netsets.IPNet should match the API for sets, at least as much as is implemented.\n\nThis one is AWS only, so I don't think we should let it escape pkg/cloudproviders/providers/aws.\n",
