That makes perfect sense for values with no fractional part; not sure it's so good for fractions (\"cores = 5.3\" would be much nicer here).  Maybe we can extend it to \"make the value an int on output, unless the value > 1.0 and there's a fractional part, in which case keep the decimal point in the usual place\"?\n",
