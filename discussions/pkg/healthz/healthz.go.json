Second, this allows us to register default health checks (right now only ping but later I could see watch health, apiserver connection health on this list as well).\n\nI couldn't think of a good way to support both these cases with one function without complicating the healthz.go code, but I'll revisit when I have some bandwidth (hopefully soon).\n",
