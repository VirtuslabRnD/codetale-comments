        "body" : "This test proves that the wait command is able to await multiple resources, which is what the use-case that `--all` expands to. Neither of these tests are checking for flag-parsing as this is not made in the wait package but is a part of `genericclioptions`. Flag parsing should thus not be tested here as it is covered under `k8s.io/cli-runtime/pkg/genericclioptions`. This test should be here, as there was no previous test ensuring that `wait` was able to handle multiple resources. Which is relevant when this change is introduced.",
