        "body" : "I'd be happy to do that, but alpha is a little bit different from set/rollout/config as its more of a container for commands rather than a command with subcommands. For example, `config get` and `config set` are related subcommands that operate on `config`, but `alpha debug` and `alpha foo` are unrelated other than both being in an alpha state.\r\n\r\nAlso, the commands in alpha could themselves have subcommands, which would make the \"Usage: kubectl alpha SUBCOMMAND [options]\" not quite correct. \r\n\r\nAs its coded now, without a run function, Usage will be omitted from help and look like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nThese commands correspond to alpha features that are not enabled in Kubernetes clusters by default.                                                                            \r\n                                                                                                                                                                               \r\nAvailable Commands:                                                                                                                                                            \r\n  debug       Run a debug container in a pod                                                                                                                                   \r\n                                                                                                                                                                               \r\nUse \"kubectl <command> --help\" for more information about a given command.   \r\n```\r\n\r\nIf we were to give it a default run function and set Use to  \"alpha COMMAND\", then the help would be:\r\n```\r\nThese commands correspond to alpha features that are not enabled in Kubernetes clusters by default.                                                                            \r\n                                                                                                                                                                               \r\nAvailable Commands:                                                                                                                                                            \r\n  debug       Run a debug container in a pod                                                                                                                                   \r\n                                                                                                                                                                               \r\nUsage:                                                                                                                                                                         \r\n  kubectl alpha COMMAND [options]                                                                                                                                           \r\n                                                                                                                                                                               \r\nUse \"kubectl <command> --help\" for more information about a given command.                                                                                                     \r\nUse \"kubectl options\" for a list of global command-line options (applies to all commands). \r\n```",
