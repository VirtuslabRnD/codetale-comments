The suggestion goes back to my disagreement regarding expected/unexpected behavior using flags i had prior, please look at the history, regarding how it is implemented now. If you feel strongly about this, I think it would be best we get together and discuss it in detail and perhaps discuss some enforcement throughout the code, or what exists atm. ",
