We verified in past that its leads to confusion in the head of users (was it `delete` or `remove`??) much more often than convenience, so we prefer to use suggestions and educate our users to the one single command available that does each thing.\r\n\r\nThat said, in some very specific areas they are valid and in my opinion this one (`use` specifically) is a good one. Switching contexts is a very common action if you use multiple of them. In OpenShift in past we had it as a top-level command and I remember using `rhc use dev`, `rhc use stg`, `rhc use prod` a lot.\r\n\r\nSo I'm in favor of `use` → `use-context`, but only this one.",
