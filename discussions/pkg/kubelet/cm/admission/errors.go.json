It's easier if I just propose a patch on top of this than try and explaining everything in text. I will send you something later today or tomorrow to see what you think.",

I thought about extending the `Error` interface somehow but I stopped short because I could only think of what would end up to be a poor man alternative of type assertion, and came with the approach I proposed. But your solution avoid that direction completely. I'll switch to your direction.",
