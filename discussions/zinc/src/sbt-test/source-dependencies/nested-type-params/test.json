I prefer this style of pointing out issues since if I leave it as a last command and change `test` to `pending` *any* failure  will make this test green. There is an issue for this and if someone fix the problem this test will fail and comment in this line will tell that person that this is expected state.\r\n\r\nPreviously tests was green since there was 3 files and changing 2 of them was over 50% and problematic compilation was in fact clean-build.",

Let me propose something similar that I think it's better: let's change `pending` to mean \"there's one or more statements in this test case that fail but should succeed\". How do we mark the statements that are \"PENDING\"? Well, I have two suggestions:\r\n\r\n1. `# PENDING` at the end of the statement.\r\n2. `!>` and `!->` instead of `>` and `->`.\r\n  \r\nI don't mind which one you eventually pick. The thing is that with this change:\r\n\r\n* We know by just looking for file names which test cases are to be done.\r\n* We know within the file which statements should be the ones that pass/fail.\r\n  \r\nThis requires a change in the scripted implementation, but shouldn't take long. Could you do it @romanowski ? What does everyone think here?",
