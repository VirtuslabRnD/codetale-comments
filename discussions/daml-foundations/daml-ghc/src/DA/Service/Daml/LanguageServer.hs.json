Otherwise you might end up with the same file represented twice by different keys which is going to be a mess. The reason why this works atm is probably because the IDE gets the initial filepath from VSCode which is absolute so we only ever use absolute filepaths.\r\n\r\nThis issue seems to have existed before, so I would just leave things for now (unless we see an actual issue) and rethink this carefully. It seems like we might want to move to URIs for keys in our Shake graph and then relativize at the edges where we care about it (at least when converting to DAML-LF but probably also in error messages printed to a terminal).",
