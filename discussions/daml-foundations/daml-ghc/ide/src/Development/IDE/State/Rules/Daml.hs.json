        "body" : "`ScenarioValidation` is currently in `//daml-foundations/daml-ghc/ghc-compiler` (whether that’s a good name is another question, there is definitely DAML-specific stuff in there) which does not depend on the scenario service client. On the other hand the scenario service client does not depend on `ghc-compiler`. So using the same type would make the dependency tree less parallel which I was trying to avoid. That said, given that the scenario service client doesn’t change too often it would probably be reasonable to make `ghc-compiler` depend on it but we might want to avoid until we finally reorganize the whole mess in `daml-foundations`.",
