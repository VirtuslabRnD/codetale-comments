        "body" : "@uniqueiniquity  Thanks for your advice to improving our types! In fact, we tried to generate more specific function-type param in our custom Object/module descriptor file format with `.idl` suffix (you can learn more details of it [here](https://github.com/fibjs/fibjs/blob/master/idl/us-en/global.idl)), it was born to generate header file and virtual class base of fibjs's C++ source code(like [this one](https://github.com/fibjs/fibjs/blob/master/fibjs/include/ifs/global.h) you could found words **This file was automatically generated using idlc.js**). So, sometimes definitions of `.idl` cannot  always specify one explicit one typescript's function type(or say, interface), in this case, we can just mark it as `Function` rather than specific interface :(\r\n\r\nWe are considering add some type-notation of `.idl` to specify function-type/interface, but that's not one simple determination, we must be so careful that we cannot change it right now. As one remediation, we provided full test case as usage sample about these function-type param, with detailed document in `*.idl`(such as [definition of Sandbox::Sandbox](https://github.com/fibjs/fibjs/blob/master/idl/us-en/SandBox.idl#L26))",
