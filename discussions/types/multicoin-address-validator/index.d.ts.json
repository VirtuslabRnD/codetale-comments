        "body" : "My reasoning behind not including the additional properties was that some of them (such as `regexp`, `regex`, `hashFunction`, and `iAddressTypes`) are used in only a couple of currencies, and there are some inconsistencies in the types. For example, I noticed that the `addressTypes` property of Tron contains `number[]` whereas the other currencies with this property have `string[]`.\r\n\r\nI think that most of the properties are only meant to be used in the currency's private implementations of `isValidAddress`, though perhaps declaring their types would still be useful.",
