This actually tests being able to pass in an array of objects rather than just an array of numbers, so it's slightly different.\r\n\r\nI didn't want to uncomment it right now, but I could see how it could be useful to remind us of other test-cases once we get around to writing more later on.\r\n\r\nI'm less concerned about this commented-out test, and more concerned with the tests below it (lines 16-26), which appear to be a copy of the first uncommented test-case (lines 3-9) except with the addition of the curried test-case. I had removed other duplicate tests for other functions, so I'm not 100% sure why I left that one behind.\r\n\r\nStill, no harm no foul. We can clean them up further later-on.",
