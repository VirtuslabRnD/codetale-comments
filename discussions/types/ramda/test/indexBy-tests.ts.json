Still, I think it would allow something like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n- test/\r\n  - helpers/\r\n    - models.ts\r\n  - bar-tests.ts\r\n  - baz-tests.ts\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'd just want to avoid having a `test/test-helpers.ts` file that would get lost in the sea of files under `test/`.\r\n\r\nAt any rate, I'd like to hold off on it for this PR and have it be part of the wider test improvements that will come after the `ramda-tests.ts` split is complete.",
