I imagine there could be scenarios where tooling may not alert that a deprecated type is being used but would on a deprecated property.\r\n\r\nAlso, the deprecations serve different purposes. The one on the type encourages users to use the more accurate `JQuery.Event` type and only has compile-time consequences. The ones on the properties are to notify about potential loss of support and has run-time consequences.",
