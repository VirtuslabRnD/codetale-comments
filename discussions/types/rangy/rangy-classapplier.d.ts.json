But `getNativeTextRange` isn't part of the Class Applier module, so I'll leave that for a separate PR.\r\n\r\nMy intention here was to do a first PR of a manageable size to get a feel for the whole process of submitting to DefinitelyTyped, and to do a bigger PR solving all the issues with Rangy after that (there are some other modules that would need to be typed, and some methods like `rangy.init()` are still undefined here). I'm happy to take care of them, just in the next PR ðŸ˜Š ",
