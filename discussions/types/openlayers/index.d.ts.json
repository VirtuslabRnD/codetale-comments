And it's still behind the current version that comes from npm (v4.6.4). On one hand I really need the performance boost that comes from this option on layer.Vector, but on the other one I don't feel comfortable bringing a version mismatch on other things, even though it worked fine till now. I could dedicate another couple of hours in the next 24 hours to update other parts of the definitions, but I've got no idea if it will be enough. And this PR would not be relevant anymore by then.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?\r\n",
