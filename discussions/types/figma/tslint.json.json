In that sense, the empty `figma` package on NPM is perfect for security purposes. In case someone gets confused and thinks they need to `npm install figma` to make plugins work (they don't), nothing bad will happen.\r\n\r\n(Just to re-clarify, the owner of the NPM `figma` is my CTO is aware that we're doing this.)",
