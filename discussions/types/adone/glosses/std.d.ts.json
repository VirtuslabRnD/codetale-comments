        "body" : "The only dependent for this package on npm is [bloater](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bloater), which just depends on the first 1000 dependencies on npm, and is an attempt to just publish a really large package by the looks of it.\r\n\r\nThe `adone` npm package itself is deprecated, and the github project, while recently updated ~20 days ago, doesn't seem to have the `std` namespace anymore.\r\n\r\nOf the two maintainers of these types, one no longer exists on github, and the other has no active contributions.\r\n\r\nI believe it's acceptable in this case to slightly weaken the types of a single package that doesn't appear to be used anymore, vs not having assertion guards in `@types/node`.\r\n\r\nHappy to break this out into another PR if needed.",
