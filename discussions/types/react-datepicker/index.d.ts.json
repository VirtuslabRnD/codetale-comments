I can of course remove the formatting, but I was thinking that it would be better to conform to the Prettier config of DefinitelyTyped. What do you think?\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped#common-mistakes\r\nhttps://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/blob/master/.prettierrc.json",

Using Prettier myself too, just found it a bit strange that the PR was making both a semantic and a formatting change. In my projects, aligning with Prettier is usually done in isolated PRs to ease reviews.",
