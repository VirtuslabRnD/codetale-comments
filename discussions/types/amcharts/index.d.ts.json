The added version number follows improvement suggestions from @micksatana and should provide information which version is supposed to be supported by now and in future. If from now on major version changes come, I will follow your instructions.\r\nFor adding the version number to the unknown state, I hope it is ok, to not have the unknown state any longer?",
