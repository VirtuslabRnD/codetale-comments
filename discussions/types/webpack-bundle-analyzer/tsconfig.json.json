Do you need to install type definitions for node? Try `npm i --save-deias 'webpack'.\r\n```\r\nIt looks like without these paths the test code is trying to use the typings in this repo and getting confused. I'm not familiar enough with all this stuff to fully understand why this is happening. Is the correct thing to to here to follow the [Removing a package](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped#removing-a-package) for the @types/webpack package for v5+ and tapable v2+ seeing as webpack and tapable now bundle their own types?\r\n```",

Is there a special section of the readme I'm missing for these cases where the typings are now part of the package but not removed from here for backward compatibility reasons?",

The tsconfig doesn't ship to npm, so the path mapping is just to make DT compile correctly.\r\n\r\nThis is a one-off for webpack for now, and I haven't figured out how or where to document it.",
