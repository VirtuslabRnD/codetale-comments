        "body" : "@r3nya Regarding bumping version, I'm not sure.  I see v4.4.11 latest (https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-widgets), v4.2.6 latest on Git tags (https://github.com/jquense/react-widgets), and I'm not sure what other features / changes there were between 4.3 (most recent typing) and 4.4.11 or 4.2.6.\r\n\r\nRegarding \"Is this option included in version 4.3\", I just found that it is _not_.  That change seems to first appear in https://github.com/jquense/react-widgets/commit/ff2c4e96791d8c8e87e6a5afc7873da377ac08f2, which correlates to 4.4.x (https://github.com/jquense/react-widgets/releases?after=react-widgets-simple-number%404.1.15).  I checked v4.4.0 and v4.4.2 and it _did_ have busySpinner.\r\n\r\nSummary: as of v4.4.0, busySpinner appeared; v4.4.2 was created the same day, so that would be my recommendation for version to attach this change to.\r\n\r\nI am not sure what other typing changes are missing from the v4.4.2, but this should improve typing for v4.4.2 over what is there now.\r\n\r\nDoes that help? :)",
