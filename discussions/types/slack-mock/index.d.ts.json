        "body" : "`events` is kinda like a list where you can put things in using `send(EventUrl, T)` and get things using `calls`. The things that you put in should be the same type as the things you get out. The same goes for its siblings: `incomingWebhooks`, `interactiveButtons`, etc. From the library, I have deduced two requirements: the type should be defined by the user and the type could be different between the siblings.\r\n\r\nThe type, `T`, which I have lefted as `any`, should be defined by the user as it largely depends on which slack library the user is using. Furthermore, the type definition could change in response to an update in the slack API. \r\n\r\nThe type may be different between siblings as it is demonstrated in the current node slack SDK.\r\n\r\nI think that the current use of `any` could be improved so that it is more strongly typed while also compatible to usage without types in typescript. Is there anyway to achieve this?",

In this case it assumes that they are the same type `T`. \r\n\r\nYour answer got me thinking of another extreme approach:\r\n\r\n```\r\ninterface Instance<A, B, C, D, E, F, G> {\r\n    events: Event<A>;\r\n    incomingWebhooks: IncomingWebhooks<B>;\r\n    interactiveButtons: InteractiveButtons<C>;\r\n    outgoingWebhooks: OutgoingWebhooks<D>;\r\n    ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\nbut it seems very very impractical. I think that if it is too hard to do so, maybe it should just leave it as `any`.\r\n",
