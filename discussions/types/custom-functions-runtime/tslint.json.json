This type has the advantage that it works better with advanced types (`ReturnType<T>` for example), but it means that users can't store functions created via `Function('code')` in CustomFunctionMappings. \r\n\r\nThe test example uses a normal function declaration `ADD10`. Do you know what users will do?",

Essentially, the CustomFunctionMappings object is just a redirecter to the right function; and the d.ts is also used for auto-generated reference docs, where \"Function\" looks cleaner than the (...args: any[]) => any notation (esp. for non-TypeScript developers).  So if it's OK with you, we'd like to submit as is for now, and we can tweak in the future if we see a clear advantage for this scenario to be typed differently",
