        "body" : "In this PR I was focusing on adding the new APIs that the upstream `uuid` module added in the latest version. The options objects have so far not been exposed, so while I agree that this is probably nice to have, it's at least not a regression with respect to the current state of the types.\r\n\r\nCould we maybe first get this merged since people are waiting for it https://github.com/uuidjs/uuid/issues/502 and keep submitting incomplete PRs for these missing APIs https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/pull/46477 & https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/pull/46557?\r\n\r\nI'm of course happy to submit the proposed improvements in another PR, but I'd really prefer to get the types in sync with the upstream module API as quickly as possible.",
