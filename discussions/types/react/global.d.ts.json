        "body" : "> How common is this?\r\n\r\nCurrently it's not possible, but it is a goal to allow React Native projects to compile without the DOM since it would allow code to compile that cannot run. I don't know how many other environments there are like this, but I suspect that React code running in Node exclusively for server-side rendering may also want to leave the DOM APIs out.\r\nTo quote from the original [React 14 announcement](https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2015/07/03/react-v0.14-beta-1.html):\r\n_As we look at packages like react-native, react-art, react-canvas, and react-three, it's become clear that the beauty and essence of React has nothing to do with browsers or the DOM._\r\n\r\nI haven't used those other projects myself so I'm not sure how relevant they are or even if they use/support TypeScript.\r\n\r\n>should this go into React Native .d.ts instead then?\r\n\r\nIt could, but since React does support running in environments outside the browser, the case could be made that the React types should also support compiling without `--lib dom`. It would also allow any future DOM dependencies added to React's `index.d.ts` to also include the placeholder declaration in `global.d.ts` so that non-DOM users of the type won't become broken when upgrading.\r\n",
