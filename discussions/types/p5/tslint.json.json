        "body" : "I managed to remove some custom rules but the two that remains are extremely difficult to fix.\r\nThe definitions are generated by a custom tool that reads the project's YUIDoc data (basically JSDoc).\r\nThat data does not contain the necessary information (yet?) to emit a more specific type than `Function` (that's why we need a custom \"ban-types\") and I can't come up with a good way for our tool to merge signatures since there can be different comments for each overload (that's why we need to disable \"unified-signatures\").\r\nFixing these errors by hand is not really an option since it would be quite labour intensive and risks being undone when we want to run the tool again as changes to the documentation/methods are made.\r\n\r\nAs stated in the first comment I also need some guidance on how to include some files in the generated project without having them automatically imported (that would pollute global scope + augment the p5 instance with things that are not available unless those files are imported).",
