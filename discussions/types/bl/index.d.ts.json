Having said that, I'm not sure I understand how the comment you linked answers the question - first class types would be great but users of v4 would still consume `@types/bl` and might still want bug fixes for those types.  If usage of v4 is limited or if the types are simple enough to be \"obviously correct\", then it's probably not worthwhile.",

There are already known issues/shortcomings with the v4 typings, for example.\r\n\r\nI was attempting to balance that against how much longer this package would need to be maintained, but now that I think about it more, I realize that this @types/bl package can really never be deprecated because older versions of bl still need it.\r\n\r\nSo I agree with you now :) We should folder-ize this package.",
