With the existing type definitions, interfaces, types and operations working with Mongo documents are typed directly to the proper document type, not to \"a document type defaulting to something less well typed\". Both observe and observeChanges functions receive their document type from the Cursor, which had been typed already by the standards of type definitions already in place. I do not think defaults should be put in there",
