This API relies on the ChromeSetting prototype of the type API for getting and setting individual accessibility features. In order to get feature states the extension must request accessibilityFeatures.read permission. For modifying feature state, the extension needs accessibilityFeatures.modify permission. Note that accessibilityFeatures.modify does not imply accessibilityFeatures.read permission.\n * @since Availability: Since Chrome 37.\n * Permissions: \"accessibilityFeatures.read\" (For read access); \"accessibilityFeatures.modify\" (For modifications; Note that accessibilityFeatures.modify does not imply accessibilityFeatures.read permission.)"
