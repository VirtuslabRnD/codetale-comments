I tried typing these 2 but there are two things to consider:\r\n\r\n1. react mixins are on their way out of the ecosystem.\r\n2. typing them is useless. since it's impossible to implicitly add type information to a class created by `createClass`. React doesn't even support mixins with es2015 classes.\r\n\r\nI only put these here for completeness. ",
