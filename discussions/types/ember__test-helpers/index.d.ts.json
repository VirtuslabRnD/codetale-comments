See https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped#if-a-library-is-updated-to-a-new-major-version-with-breaking-changes-how-should-i-update-its-type-declaration-package for details on how to do that. The tl;dr is to copy the existing types into a `v1/` directory and make a couple of tweaks to `v1/tsconfg.json`. The instructions I linked describe what to do in detail with an example. After you have done that, you can bump the version and make these changes in the root `types/ember__test-helpers/` directory.",
