In place of this, you can require your package.json file, so this line ends up looking like:\r\n\r\npkg: require(\"../package.json\")\r\n\r\nI wasn't sure of the utility of trying to type that.\r\n\r\nThe full definition of this type, btw, is:\r\n\r\n`export type Plugin = PluginBase & (PluginNameVersion | PluginPackage);`",
