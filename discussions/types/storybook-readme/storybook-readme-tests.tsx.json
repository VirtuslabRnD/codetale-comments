Problem is when I had to write a test on this. Since it is a type definition, it looks fine... or maybe not. What do you think? Should I use another test files for this? ",

However when I was writing this test, I wanted to verify if newly added `addReadme` from `storybook-readme/html` is importing fine and its imported value(`addReadme`) can be an argument of `addDecorator(addHtmlReadme)`\r\nSo as you said, doing like this looks fine.
