        "body" : "The library is actually a wrapper around a dll. The handles are only meaningful to the underlying code and a user of the library should not be passing anything that was not received from the library as a Handle.\r\n\r\nThere are cases where functions (e.g., `GetElement`) take `0` in place of a Handle. I tried to make all such functions accept `0` as well as `Handle` but it appears I missed that one.\r\n\r\nI will get rid of that and just alias `Handle` to `number` if that is preferred, otherwise I will double check for others I missed.",
