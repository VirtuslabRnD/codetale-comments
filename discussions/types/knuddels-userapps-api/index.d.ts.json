        "body" : "These interfaces/types have been on the global scope already, before the last PR. In the last PR a few weeks ago I accidentally removed them from the scope. This was caused by re-writing our algorithm that creates this file. We do not maintain it manually, it gets generated with information from our documentation. And since the developers using our API need to use these interfaces for some of our APIs we have to make them available. Moving them inside a namespace for example would be a breaking change we don't want to introduce now.",
