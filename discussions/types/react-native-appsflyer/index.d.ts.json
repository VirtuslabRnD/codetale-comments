I was trying to do the same with namespace so that it follows how the library APIs are used i.e `appsFlyer.<method>`.\r\n\r\nThanks for reviewing though! I'm learning along the way.\r\n\r\nAbout supporting `export default namespace`, I suppose it is related to this PR.\r\nhttps://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/pull/18628\r\n",
