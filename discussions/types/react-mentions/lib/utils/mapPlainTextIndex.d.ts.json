So I /think/ technically the types version is correct and this signature was just busted for v3.x version before.\r\n\r\nHowever, since there are so many updates, and react-mentions is at v4.x now, I'm wondering if we shouldn't go ahead and [bump the major version of this types package](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped#if-a-library-is-updated-to-a-new-major-version-with-breaking-changes-how-should-i-update-its-type-declaration-package) to v4.1 (or the oldest version you're confidence these types are compatible with). I think you can just update [the major.minor version number listed in the first line of the index.d.ts file](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/blob/3ea27f607b34b9bab74940348292c7fffaf3b0b4/types/react-mentions/index.d.ts#L1) from this:\r\n\r\n> // Type definitions for react-mentions 3.3\r\n\r\nto this\r\n\r\n> // Type definitions for react-mentions 4.1\r\n\r\nLet me know your thoughts!",
