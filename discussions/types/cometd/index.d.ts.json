So this could be:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n/**\r\n * Uses the scheduler service available in Web Workers via `Worker.setTimeout(fn, delay)` rather\r\n * than using that available via `Window.setTimeout(fn, delay)`. Browsers are now throttling the\r\n * `Window` scheduler in background tabs to save battery in mobile devices, so the `Window`\r\n * scheduler events are delayed by possibly several seconds, causing CometD sessions to timeout on\r\n * the server. The `Worker` scheduler is not throttled and guarantees that scheduler events happen\r\n * on time.\r\n */\r\n```",
