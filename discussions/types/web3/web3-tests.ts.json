I do not think that we should introduce such a \"blacklist check\". I would remove this and all other checks of the same type below. It is technically correct but confusing to read and there is no \"logic\" behind the question of when or when not to add such a check elsewhere in the project. I think they should be removed again.",

I'm not sure if this goal was achieved, but I was trying to handle the case where someone updates `web3` type definitions on a (unknowingly buggy) live project, sees compiler errors and makes a PR returning these deleted fields.\r\n\r\nThis PR was already merged, but if you insist we should remove the checks, I can make another PR.",
