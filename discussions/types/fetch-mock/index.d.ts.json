Note that `MockResponse` is used for specifying mock responses. The callable here is meant to be used in actual code, that is obviously unaware of `fetch()` being mocked.",

This method on .sandbox() appears to come from https://github.com/wheresrhys/fetch-mock/blob/master/src/lib/fetch-handler.js#L5, which does look to return a `Promise<Response>`, so I'd be content to merge this - thank you for pulling it together!",
