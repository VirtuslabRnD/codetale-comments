And https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped#my-package-teststs says that the tests should show how the API is being used. And @typescript-bot says there's no problem with test performance.\r\n\r\nBut in the interests of getting this PR merged, and since I'm not expecting code breakage anytime soon, I've removed the dependency on Gulp as requested 8f1cf7a.",
