Should these definitions be using the CommonJS style too or do you have some code to convert over to global scope?",

I was trying to do my very best and I hoped this would help other people.\r\nYou are right: All the types are put in the global scope by my definition.\r\nBackgroundDownloadPromise and Deferral really are only accessable through the return value of DownloadOperation#startAsync. And BackgroundDownloader really is only acessable through BackgroundTransfer.BackgroundDownloader but needs to be newable.\r\nShould I change some of them to interfaces instead of classes?\r\nI would be very grateful if you have an advise how to improve my definition. Or a link to a tutorial to do so.\r\nThank you very much!",
