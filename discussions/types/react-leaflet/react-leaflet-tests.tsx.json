        "body" : "I introduced type parameters to get better type checking on extensions to react-leaflet classes. They allow extending classes to pass custom prop types and custom leafletElement types to inherited members. Unfortunately, this introduces a bit of extra syntax in cases like the one referenced above. It would be possible to reintroduce a `MarkerInstance` type that simply uses the default type parameters `MarkerProps` and `Leaflet.Marker`. I see two problems with this, though:\r\n1. If we create `MapInstance` and `MarkerInstance` types, as in the present version, why stop there? For consistency, there should ideally be such -`Instance` types for _every_ react-leaflet class.\r\n2. Because I've defined `Map`, `Marker`, and indeed every react-leaflet component as a true TypeScript class rather than a `const` representing the constructor, defining separate types for their instances seems unnecessary, since the type of the instance is the same as the type of the class.",
