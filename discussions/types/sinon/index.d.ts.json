Can you provide a reference for this?\r\n\r\nI do see it's included in the Sinon source code, but I don't think that undocumented or private APIs are supposed to be included in typings. So this change might require clarification from the Sinon developers and a doc change before being accepted.\r\n\r\nAnyone more deeply involved with DefinitelyTyped please correct me on this if I'm wrong about what should be accepted!",
