The original PR was intended to split the gap between two other contributors.\r\n\r\nThat being said, would something like\r\n```typescript\r\nimport * as React from 'react';\r\nimport { CSSModule } from '../index';\r\n\r\nexport interface BreadcrumbProps extends React.HTMLAttributes<HTMLElement> {\r\n  tag?: string;\r\n  className?: string;\r\n  listTag?: string;\r\n  listClassName?: string;\r\n  cssModule?: CSSModule;\r\n}\r\n\r\ndeclare class Breadcrumb<T = {[key: string]: any}> extends React.Component<BreadcrumbProps & T> {}\r\nexport default Breadcrumb;\r\n```\r\nstill have the performance hit? It still cuts down on the number of types since we could keep the `index.html` from this merge, and if someone wanted the strictness, they could use the generic.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure how you got your timing numbers, otherwise I would test that change myself.",
