Have each user of mini-css-extract-plugin install `@types/node` and add `types: [\"node\"]` to their tsconfig.\r\n\r\n(3) is bad for usability of this package. (1) is .. mysterious. (2) is probably the right fix. I'll look at webpack's setup and see whether it makes sense for it to add the reference.\r\n\r\nEven if (2) is right, then it'll have to wait for a new version of webpack. So you could take this change in order to get this PR merged.",
