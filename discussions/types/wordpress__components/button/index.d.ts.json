However you could also argue that this is just a bug fix, since it doesn't look like `isToggled` ever did anything.\r\n\r\nDoes it make sense to leave the `isToggled` type there but mark it as `@deprecated`? That way when folks update from `@types/wordpress__components@9.8.5` to `@types/wordpress__components@9.8.x` there builds won't break which is expected for a minor version bump. Then when we can remove `isToggled` in `@types/wordpress__components@10.0.0`.",
