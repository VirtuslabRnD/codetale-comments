        "body" : "Testing using `result = x` is an old way of doing it, and it's not very good because it only proves that `x` is *assignable to* `Array<AbcObject[keyof AbcObject]>`. It doesn't prove that the return type is *exactly* `Array<AbcObject[keyof AbcObject]>`. For example, `_.at()` could return `any`, and this test would still pass.\r\n\r\nA better way is to use `$ExpectType`:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n_.at(abcObject, 'a', ['b'], ['a', 'b']); // $ExpectType AbcObject[keyof AbcObject][]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe downside is that `dtslint` does a dumb string comparison when it sees `$ExpectType`, so your type needs to *exactly match* what `dtslint` is expecting, including whitespace. Also, you'll need to use `[]` instead of `Array<>`.\r\n\r\nAlso, since `$ExpectType` allows you to remove `let result: x;`, the braces (`{}`) are no longer necessary. i.e. instead of this:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n{\r\n    _.at(abcObject, 'a', ['b'], ['a', 'b']); // $ExpectType AbcObject[keyof AbcObject][]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\njust do this:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n_.at(abcObject, 'a', ['b'], ['a', 'b']); // $ExpectType AbcObject[keyof AbcObject][]\r\n```",

I started updating some unit tests and writing new unit tests using $ExpectType comments later on. It's hard to decide when to follow the existing pattern vs when to rework to the better approach. Gotta be careful to avoid going down the rabbit hole that results in every unit test being rewritten and creating an impossibly gigantic PR to review.\r\n\r\nI'll work on updating some more of these test cases. Let me know if you have any good advice on how far down the rabbit hole I should go.",
