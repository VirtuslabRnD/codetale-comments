Because yesterday at work I had to fix a bug where `Scalafix` ran using `organize-imports`, and then we forgot to remove `SortImport` from Scalafmt, which ran after. So Scalafix would do this `{B, a}`, and then scalafmt would do this `{a, B}`, and then our CI would fail on the Scalafix check ðŸ˜† . So if you mentioned the default, maybe best to not just say alphabetically, but Ascii.",
