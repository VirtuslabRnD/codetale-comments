In some ways these are very similar. if you have another place to put it, let me know.\r\n\r\nAs for making it external from KCM -- as this is part of cluster bootstrap I'm not sure what other process it would belong in. At the end of the day, we can't introduce a new daemon for every controller.  Well, we could, but it would be a bit crazy.  Binding a lot of controllers into the KCM is a necessary efficiency trade off.",
