This is sort of common to Go, where \"a little duplication is better than a little dependency\".  I think that the other users of this will be eliminated as their codegen is cleaned up, too, so I think we should leave it as-is for now.  If you feel strongly, I can just move the OrDie func into the common lib.\n",
