It's not obvious to me where that line is drawn and some things seem unusual.  For instance, there is a file reference for a kubeconfigfile that refers to something on disk.  1. the kubeconfig is needed in order to contact the apiserver to find the configmap config, and 2. I don't think I would expect the disk layout across all schedulers to be consistent.",
